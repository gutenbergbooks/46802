<h2 class="no-break"><a id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p>People having only casual interest in insects usually express amazement
when they learn how much is known about this most numerous
group of animals. However, while entomologists have good reason to
take pride in the accomplishments of their contemporaries and predecessors,
they are more likely to be appalled by how much remains to
be learned. We are indeed ignorant of even the identity of fully half
and probably much more than half the total number of insect species.
Of those that have been described, we have reasonably complete information
about the behavior and basic environmental relationships
for only a comparative few. The great majority of the remainder are
known only from specimens found in museum collections. Such information
as we have about these species usually amounts to no more
than date and locality of collection.</p>

<p>This is true of the cockroaches, which now include approximately
3,500 described species. Conservative estimates based on partially
studied museum collections and the percent of new species found in
recent acquisitions, particularly from tropical and subtropical countries,
indicate that at least 4,000 species remain unnamed. Although
the group is well known in general terms to nearly all entomologists,
there is an almost complete void of information about all except the
few domestic species and, to a progressively diminishing degree, some
400 others. Many details about the lives of even those that share man's
habitations are not fully understood. This then is a rough measure of
how little is known about cockroaches.</p>

<p>With the exception of mosquitoes and a few other comparatively
small groups of insects on which work has been concentrated, it is
doubtful if any other comparable segment of the world's insect fauna
is better known. Already an estimated 800,000 kinds of insects have
been described, and since this figure is generally regarded as less than
half the actual total, think what this means in terms of knowledge
yet to be assembled. No wonder entomology is a growing science with
a promising future, but the magnitude of the task also presents a
serious obstacle to progress. Progress can continue only if the
scattered literature resulting from the diversified labors of hundreds
of contributors is brought together and summarized in thorough and
well-organized compilations that can serve as a solid basis for future
research.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>The present work is such a compilation, for it assembles what has
been gleaned from approximately 1,700 sources, including correspondence
with a large number of other workers. Original observations
during some eight years of concentrated effort in U. S. Army Quartermaster
research laboratories are a valuable supplement to what
others have done, and with this background of experience the authors
are especially well qualified to appraise previous work. Seldom has
a compilation been done so thoroughly or a single large group of insects
been the subject of such uninterrupted effort.</p>

<p>The contents gives the categories of subject matter treated and the
introduction discusses the value of this assembled information and
offers suggestions for future study. No longer are cockroaches regarded
only as disagreeable pests; many species appear to be important,
actually or potentially, as carriers of disease. Recognition of
this importance has grown considerably, even in the period since
World War II. Consequently, anything that increases our knowledge
of the basic bionomics of cockroaches will be consulted widely for
factual information and for clues to new approaches.</p>

<p>In spite of this extensive compilation, the limitations of present
information about cockroach bionomics must be kept in mind. The
cited observations of many writers were fragmentary, or their conclusions
disagreed. But it is fundamental to scientific inquiry that we
should know and attempt to evaluate the results of previous study, and
that is what Drs. Roth and Willis have done. Fortunately, their review
is readily available. Sometimes, a piece of work fails to be of
maximum value because the results are not generally accessible to
later students. For this reason I am especially glad that the Smithsonian
Institution, by disseminating the results of the authors' labors,
has this opportunity to exercise one of its traditional functions&mdash;that
of diffusing knowledge.</p>

<p>Throughout the period of research by Drs. Roth and Willis at
Natick, I was in frequent correspondence with them, and I admire
their many accomplishments. Our warmest commendations should
go not only to them personally but also to those in administration
who encouraged their fundamental research and who aided in the
financial support of this publication.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="I_INTRODUCTION">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>Recently we brought together much of the literature linking cockroaches
with the transmission of certain organisms that cause disease
in man and other vertebrates. In that paper (1957a) we concluded
that cockroaches, being potential vectors of pathogenic agents, should
not be regarded simply as minor annoyances. Obviously the associations
of cockroaches with agents of vertebrate diseases are of more
immediate importance than their relations with pathogens of lower
animals or with nonpathogens. On the other hand, cockroaches are of
general economic as well as medical importance, and their control is
sought by many who are unaware of their medical significance. That
the control of domiciliary cockroaches is far from satisfactory may be
inferred from current entomological and pest-control journals in which
new insecticides are continually advocated to replace others found to
be inadequate. Possibly new approaches to the control of cockroaches
are needed. Whether these lie in the direction of increased use of
parasites and predators for the biological control of these insects
remains to be seen. In any event, the more we know about any insect,
especially its ecology, the greater the likelihood of achieving satisfactory
control. In order to advance knowledge in any field of science,
new research should proceed from the results of prior investigations
when these exist. We hope that the observations and experiments
cited herein may suggest areas for future research and exploitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>To the best of our knowledge no previous publication has brought
together the vast literature on the parasites, predators, commensals,
and other symbiotic associates of the Blattaria. For this reason, we
have tried to assemble observations on all such known associations.
Undoubtedly we have overlooked some records, as, for example, those
buried in papers dealing with other phases of cockroach biology. We
hope that such inadvertent omissions will not seriously impair the
usefulness of this compilation. Whatever its defects, this review
should be a unified source of information for all who are interested
in the biotic associates of cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In addition to previously published information, this monograph
also contains original records and observations on the associations of
cockroaches that are reported here for the first time. Although some
of the observations were made by us, others were made by colleagues
who have graciously made their knowledge available to us in private
communications.</p>


<h3>HISTORICAL</h3>

<p>Chopard (1938) in his book <i>La Biologie des Orthopt&egrave;res</i> reviewed
much of the literature on cockroaches, but of the many biotic associations
that exist he discussed only the commensal cockroaches, gregariousness,
and familial associations. Asano (1937), who reviewed the
natural enemies of cockroaches, mentioned about 10 groups of animals
that attack cockroaches. Thompson (1951) in his <i>Parasite Host
Catalogue</i>, which was based mainly on papers abstracted or noted in
the Review of Applied Entomology, listed only 19 insect parasites of
cockroaches. Eighteen of these were Hymenoptera which attack only
cockroach eggs; the single dipteron listed (<i>Sarcophaga lambens</i>
Wiedemann, supposedly parasitic on <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>) is not
a parasite in this case, but deposits its eggs on the dead insects (see
p. 229). Cameron (1955) listed as parasites and predators of the
cockroach 24 species of hymenopterous egg parasites, 7 species of
<i>Ampulex</i> which hunt nymphs and adults, 17 Protozoa, 13 nematodes,
5 bacteria, 2 mites, and a few other miscellaneous predators. In his
classified list of the protozoan parasites of the Orthoptera of the
world, Semans (1943) listed about 26 species from cockroaches. Linstow
(1878, 1889) recorded 14 species of helminths from cockroaches.
Van Zwaluwenburg (1928) listed 33 names of roundworms which
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
are commensals or secondary parasites of cockroaches, but some of
these names are synonyms. La Rivers (1949) extended this list with
13 additional species. Chitwood (1932) recognized 24 species of
nematodes which are primary parasites (probably commensals) of
blattids. Steinhaus (1946) gave many instances of biological relationships
between cockroaches and bacteria, fungi, and yeasts, but the
cockroaches were not discussed as an entity and the information is
scattered throughout the book.</p>

<p>In surveying the literature on this subject we have collected a far
more extensive list of animals and plants associated with cockroaches
than one might have expected from an examination of any one of the
previous papers on this subject. In our review of the medically important
organisms associated with the Blattaria, we pointed out that
in addition to many experimental associations cockroaches have been
found to harbor, naturally, 4 strains of poliomyelitis virus, about
40 species of pathogenic bacteria, the eggs of 7 species of pathogenic
helminths, and to serve as intermediate hosts of 12 other species of
helminths pathogenic for vertebrates; cockroaches have also been
found to carry, on occasion, 3 species of Protozoa that are pathogenic
to man and 2 species of fungi which are sometimes found associated
with pathological conditions.</p>

<p>In addition to the above organisms of medical importance, we have
compiled records of other organisms, nonpathogenic to vertebrates,
which are naturally associated in some way with cockroaches. None
of the following numbers can be considered absolute because some
names may be synonyms. However, we believe that these figures are
very close to the actual numbers of species that have been isolated
because we have attempted to refer all obvious synonyms to the
currently accepted name for each organism. On this basis there are
about 45 species of bacteria, 40 fungi, 6 yeasts, 90 Protozoa, and
45 helminths that have been found associated naturally with cockroaches.
Of the arthropods there are about 2 species of scorpions,
4 spiders, 15 mites, 4 centipedes, and 90 insects. Of vertebrates there
are 4 species of fish, 16 amphibians, 12 reptiles, 20 birds, and 27 mammals.
Besides these there are many records of experimental associations
that have been contrived in the laboratory.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Some idea of the increase in our knowledge of the biotic associations
of cockroaches, during the last 70 years, may be gathered from a
comparison of the above figures with those of Miall and Denny
(1886) who presented " ... a long list of parasites which infest the
Cockroach." This list included 2 bacteria, 6 Protozoa (some of the
names are synonyms), 7 nematodes (some of these names are also
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
synonyms), 1 mite, 1 wasp, and 1 beetle. In addition, they mentioned
as other foes of the cockroach: monkeys, hedgehogs, polecats, cats,
rats, birds, chameleons, and frogs.</p>


<h3>METHODS</h3>

<p>We have listed the organisms known to be associated with cockroaches
systematically by phylum, class, order, and family. Within
each family the organisms are listed alphabetically by genus and
species. Under each organism the associated cockroaches are listed
as natural or experimental hosts, vectors, or prey. Identified cockroaches
are listed by the currently accepted name. Unidentified cockroaches
are indicated by the word "Cockroaches." The name of each
cockroach is followed by the country in which the observation was
made, the authority for the record, and with a few exceptions<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
pertinent biological information, where this is known. Question marks
following the names of organisms or countries indicate tentative or
questionable identifications.</p>

<p>Records of predators capturing and feeding on cockroaches in zoos
and on shipboard we consider natural, even though it is very likely that
these particular predators would not normally have access to this prey
in nature.</p>

<p>Experimental prey are cockroaches that were fed to predators in
the laboratory. Although these predators may have little, if any,
access to these cockroaches in nature, we have included such records
to indicate the relative acceptability of cockroaches as food by a wide
variety of animals.</p>

<p>Records of presumed or known cockroach associates that give no
information about an associated cockroach are not included in this
review, even though certain of these (e.g., species of <i>Ampulex</i>,
<i>Evania</i>, <i>Podium</i>) probably prey upon or parasitize cockroaches
exclusively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The validity of a host-parasite or predator-prey record is dependent
upon the accuracy and knowledge of the observer. In assembling these
records we have had to accept, in most instances, the identifications
of species made by the original authors. However, as a result of our
studies on the biology of various species of cockroaches, including
some work on their hymenopterous parasites, we have questioned
certain records in the literature. Other dubious records which have
been perpetuated from one publication to the next, but which apparently
were not based on fact, have also been questioned or have
been clarified with the aid of specialists in particular groups.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Because the records cover a period of many years, the names of
many of the organisms as well as the names of some of the cockroaches
have been changed. Although it would have been comparatively
simple to list the names as they appeared in the original references,
this would have resulted in misleading redundancy with the
same organism being catalogued under several synonyms. We have
attempted to list each organism by its currently accepted name. However,
no attempt was made to prepare complete taxonomic synonymies;
the only synonyms given are those that identify the organisms by the
names used by the authors of the papers cited. The synonyms under
which the cockroaches may have been cited originally are listed in
section II. The synonyms of associated organisms are listed with
each organism. Although authorities for the name changes of the
cockroaches are given, these workers are not necessarily those who
were initially responsible for the synonymies. Various sections have
been checked by specialists in the particular groups. Although we have
accepted name changes suggested by these reviewers, we assume full
responsibility for the names.</p>


<h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
<p>After having examined thousands of references on cockroaches,
we are impressed by how little is known about the biology of most
species. As a conservative estimate there are 3,500 described species
of Blattaria (J. W. H. Rehn, 1951). In our literature survey we
found records of biotic associations for about 400 species. Unfortunately,
many of these records contain only a sentence or two of
biological information. Our detailed knowledge of cockroaches is
based on studies of the few domiciliary pests that man attempts to
eradicate. Comparable studies of the bionomics of the less-well-known
species should add much valuable information to our knowledge of
this ancient group.</p>

<p>Our understanding of most predator-prey and parasite-host relationships
has barely progressed beyond the taxonomic stage. The total
effect of predators and parasites in limiting natural populations of
cockroaches remains to be determined. It is still not known how, for
example, predatory or parasitic wasps select specific cockroaches from
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
among all other insects. Secretions produced by certain cockroaches
(e.g., 2-hexenal by <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>) will ward off certain predators.
The identities and biological activities of most cockroach secretions
are unknown, but the use of protective chemicals against predators
may be widespread among cockroaches. If so, how effective are these
repellents in protecting the individual or the species? It is not known
whether cockroaches are protected by apparent mimetic resemblances
to other arthropods. There is no experimental proof that insect parasites
can successfully attack the eggs of cockroaches that incubate
their eggs while they are being carried by the female.</p>

<p>It is conceivable that biological control of cockroaches might be
achieved in limited areas such as man-made structures or sewers, but
this possibility has not been thoroughly explored. It would be informative
to know what effects, if any, organisms such as bacteria, Protozoa
(e.g., gregarines), intestinal nematodes, or other helminths have on
cockroaches. Possibly pathogenic microorganisms can be used for
biological control of cockroaches; this approach seems to have been
little explored.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Associations of colonial cockroaches (e.g., <i>Cryptocercus</i> spp.) may
be truly familial or they may merely result from gregariousness.
Newly hatched nymphs of species that carry their o&ouml;thecae until the
eggs hatch cluster near the mother. This may be a response to the
mother as such, a search for shelter beneath the nearest object (thigmotaxis?
or negative phototaxis?), or there may well be yet another
explanation. Tepper in 1893 stated that the native cockroaches of
Australia are almost wholly carnivorous; little supporting evidence for
this claim has been brought forward since that time. The apparent
supersedure of one species of domiciliary cockroach by another may
result from antagonism between different species, or it may result
from more rapid breeding and more effective utilization of available
food and space; but which? Several species of cockroaches are frequently
found associated with certain plants (e.g., bromeliads and
bananas); the ecological relations in these associations remain to be
determined. Many of the obscure associations between cockroaches
and other insects, spiders, birds, and burrowing animals have never
been adequately defined. The factors influencing cannibalism have
never been thoroughly investigated experimentally. These are only
a few ideas for future work that have occurred to us during the
preparation of this review. We hope that these suggestions as well
as other questions that may occur to readers will stimulate further
research in areas where it is obviously needed.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="III_ECOLOGICAL_RELATIONSHIPS">III. ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS</a></h2>


<p>The ecology of extinct cockroaches is necessarily a highly speculative
subject. From the coexistence of fossil cockroaches and fossil
plants in the same geological stratum, one might conclude that there
had been intimate associations between them during prehistoric life.
Heer (1864) and Goldenberg (1877) suggested that Carboniferous
cockroaches fed on the plants with which they have been found as
fossils. Scudder (1879) concurred with this hypothesis. However,
Bolton (1911), remarking on the noticeable associations of blattoid
wings with vegetable remains, suggested that the cockroaches may
have been partly carnivorous, feeding on the snails <i>Spirorbis pusillus</i>,
which were attached to the leaves of <i>Cordaites</i>. Yet the proximity
of fossil insects and plants in the same geological formation is hardly
proof of a similar association during life. In fact, Sellards (1903),
Bolton (1921), and Laurentiaux (1951) have all pointed out that the
cockroach remains, particularly the more resistant wings, may have
been washed into streams by heavy rains and transported with drifting
plant material to places where permanent deposits were accumulating.</p>

<p>Some species of fossil cockroaches have long, well-developed ovipositors,
very unlike present-day cockroaches whose ovipositors are
small and nonprotruding. Brongniart (1889) and Zalesskii (1939,
1953) have suggested that certain Permian and Carboniferous cockroaches
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with long ovipositors may have inserted their eggs singly
into trees and other plants, rather than protecting the eggs with an
o&ouml;theca. However, Laurentiaux (1951), although conceding the
possibility of egg laying in vegetable material, suggested that oviposition
into the earth is more probable because of the unbending
nature of the ovipositor.</p>

<p>Although the ecological associations of modern cockroaches should
be well known from direct observation, actually most species are still
little more than names on museum specimens, and our knowledge of
them is fragmentary. All too frequently ecological observations have
been only incidental to taxonomic or faunistic studies; yet the biological
information that is contained in such papers is all that we know
of many species. For this reason we have cited these observations in
some detail, especially when they were brief; longer accounts of cockroach
bionomics, of necessity, have been abstracted.</p>

<p>Very few exclusively ecological studies of insects have included
cockroaches. The native woodroaches (<i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>, <i>P.
uhleriana</i>, and <i>P. virginica</i>) of the northern United States were included
in ecological studies of the Orthoptera by Hubbell (1922),
Strohecker (1937), and Cantrall (1943). Fifteen species of cockroaches
were included in an ecological study of the Orthoptera of
northern Florida by Friauf (1953). The original papers should be
consulted for detailed descriptions of the habitats and accounts of the
associated plants and other Orthoptera.</p>

<p>In this chapter the cockroaches are grouped into those that have
been found in man-made structures and those that occur in other
habitats. Certain species may appear in several categories because
they live both indoors and out. The structural pests are divided into
cockroaches that occur in land-based structures, those on ships, and
those in aircraft. The nonstructural cockroaches are divided into
those that occur in quite specific habitats (caves, water, and deserts)
and those that occur generally out of doors. Nests of various arthropods
serve as microhabitats of commensal cockroaches; these latter
associations are discussed on pages 310-318.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In this chapter our discussion is limited to the physical environment
and specific habitats of cockroaches, and only very general references
are made to associated organisms. The relationships of cockroaches
to the biota are examined in detail in subsequent chapters. To show
the full extent of the associations, the associates, from bacteroids to
vertebrates, are arranged phyletically. These associate-centered classifications
serve admirably to relate various species of cockroaches
within common bounds, but fail to give an integrated account of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
total biotic relationships in the ecology of each species. Although
physically separated in this monograph, the many associates of each
species of cockroach should all be considered in appraising the ecology
of that species. To assist the reader to achieve this end, we have included
a checklist (p. <a href="#Page_290">290</a>) which serves as a convenient index to certain
organisms associated with particular species of cockroaches.</p>


<h3>CAVE HABITATS</h3>

<p>Caves, mines, and animal burrows are somewhat similar habitats
that provide many species of cockroaches with shelter and frequently
with food. The microclimates of these cockroach habitats have not
been described in detail in the papers cited, but it seems rather obvious
that natural caves, man-made caves (mines), and burrows offer
relatively stable temperatures and humidities and protection from adverse
climatic conditions. Although such cavernicolous animals as
birds and bats periodically leave caves to search for food, cockroaches
find the accumulated guano and animal and plant detritus an entirely
adequate dietary (Chopard, 1938). Cockroaches in mines presumably
subsist on the food and feces dropped by man and mine animals
(e.g., pit ponies). Food stored in their nests by burrowing animals is
undoubtedly utilized by the associated cockroaches.</p>

<p>Cavernicolous cockroaches show varying degrees of dependence on
and adaptation to these specialized habitats. Some of the common
domiciliary species (<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Blattella germanica</i>, and <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>) may have accompanied man into caves and remained
there after he left (Chopard, 1929a, 1936, 1938). Other
species, from the paucity of records noting their occurrence in caves,
are undoubtedly accidental inhabitants that may never become established.
Besides these, however, many other species of cockroaches
have established large breeding colonies in caves. Although some
of the latter species show very pronounced morphological adaptations
to a cave life, many others resemble their noncavernicolous relatives.
The possible origin of cavernicolous Orthoptera has been discussed
by Chopard (1938).</p>

<p>Cavernicolous cockroaches have been segregated into four groups
according to their ability to adapt to their environment and the degree
of their specialized evolution (Chopard, 1936, 1938): (1) <b>Trogloxenes</b>:
Cockroaches that occur in caves in a sporadic fashion (the
domiciliary cockroaches and accidentals such as <i>Ectobius</i> and <i>Heterogamodes</i>).
(2) <b>Troglophiles</b>: Cockroaches found habitually in
caves (<i>Symploce</i>, <i>Periplaneta cavernicola</i>). (3) <b>Guanobies</b>: Cockroaches
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
that live in the guano of cavernicolous vertebrates (<i>Gyna</i>,
<i>Acanthogyna</i>, <i>Dyscologamia</i>, <i>Pycnoscelus</i>). (4) <b>Troglobies</b>: Cockroaches
that apparently cannot live outside of caves and which show
very marked adaptive characters (<i>Alluaudellina</i>, <i>Nocticola</i>, <i>Spelaeoblatta</i>,
<i>Typhloblatta</i>). For complete discussions of these groups including
descriptions of the adaptive characters shown by certain
genera, the original sources should be consulted.</p>

<p>Although we know very little of the ethology of most of the
cavernicolous cockroaches, it is intriguing that three of the six known
species of <i>Nocticola</i> are cave dwellers, two are inhabitants of termite
nests (p. <a href="#Page_315">315</a>), and one (<i>N. bolivari</i>) was found under stones and
cement blocks (Chopard, 1950b). In the rather extensive list of
cavernicolous cockroaches only two (<i>Arenivaga grata</i> and <i>Parcoblatta</i>
sp.) were taken from caves in North America north of Yucatan. All
other records are from Africa, Asia, Central America, Europe, West
Indies, East Indies, and the Philippine Islands. This we find puzzling.
Packard (1888) in his extensive study of the cave fauna of North
America listed no cockroaches. Dearolf (1941) found only the above-mentioned
<i>Parcoblatta</i> in one of 37 caves in Pennsylvania. Kohls and
Jellison (1948) listed no cockroaches among the arthropods from six
bat caves in Texas. We would expect <i>Periplaneta americana</i> to inhabit
mines in North America, but we have found no such records.
Have cockroaches been ignored in fauna collections from North
American caves, or has our cave fauna been less extensively studied
than that of other parts of the world?</p>

<p class="pmb3">The two species of cockroaches found in mines (<i>Blattella germanica</i>
and <i>Periplaneta americana</i>) are also found in caves. For this reason
we have included them in the list headed Cavernicolous Cockroaches.
On the other hand, the cockroaches found in animal burrows are
generally different species from those found in caves, so we have
grouped these together in a second list.</p>

Selangor, where it was very abundant 50 to 600 feet from entrance;
also on walls of inner cavern (Chopard, 1919, 1929). In the absence
of other evidence, the presence of <i>P. striatus</i> in a cave indicates that
bats also inhabit the cave (Chopard, 1929a).</p>

<h3>DESERT HABITATS</h3>

<p>There is relatively little ecological information about cockroaches
that live in deserts, even though certain species, notably <i>Polyphaga
aegyptiaca</i>, have long been known to inhabit arid zones. In fact, so
little is known about the ecology of arid-zone insects in general that it
is more a subject for research than for review (Pradhan, 1957). In
their account of the cockroaches of Northern Kenya and Jubaland,
Kevan and Chopard (1954) describe in some detail the vegetational
areas of this arid desert or semidesert country, which averages only
about 10 inches of rain per year. The other sources that are cited
below contain very little more biological information than the abstracted
material that is given under each species.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Polyphaginae are said to be marked xerophiles whose
distribution coincides with that of the deserts (Bei-Bienko, 1950).
With the exception of <i>Arenivaga floridana</i>, the species of Polyphaginae
in the United States all occur in the Southwest, where they are
(with a few exceptions) the only cockroaches that inhabit the desert
regions proper (Hebard, 1917). The Polyphaginae reach their
greatest diversity in the deserts of Northern Africa and Anterior and
South-Central Asia (Bei-Bienko, 1950). Some of the desert-inhabiting
species have also been found under nondesert conditions. This
only further exemplifies the plasticity of cockroaches in adapting to
different environments.</p>

<p>The ability of desert insects to live under what appear to be extremely
unfavorable conditions has been abundantly illustrated by
Pradhan (1957). Uvarov (1954) has pointed out that a desert "covers
a great variety of landscapes, which provide desert animals with a wide
range of habitats, some of them offering very favorable conditions
for life." Pradhan (1957) stated that many desert animals avoid
the extremes of desert climates by choosing suitable microclimates for
diurnal resting places, that a permanent or temporary underground
existence is very common among insects in arid zones, and that many
nocturnal Orthoptera burrow into the soil or hide under stones where
temperatures are lower. For example, the type of <i>Parcoblatta desertae</i>
was found under a boulder on the bare desert (Rehn and Hebard,
1909).</p>

<p>Symbiosis with burrowing animals is another solution to the problem
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of existence in the desert; in fact, symbiosis is a mode of life
adopted by nearly half of the desert cockroaches about which we have
any information. Vlasov and Miram (1937) found <i>Polyphaga indica</i>,
<i>Polyphaga saussurei</i>, and <i>Arenivaga roseni</i> in the burrows of rodents
and desert turtles. In the desert regions of Arizona, females of
<i>Arenivaga erratica</i> were found commonly in burrows of the kangaroo
rat (Vorhies and Taylor, 1922) and in dens of wood rats and ground
squirrels (Ball et al., 1942). <i>Arenivaga apacha</i> and <i>Arenivaga bolliana</i>
have also been found inhabiting the nests of wood rats (Hebard,
1917; 1943a). Bei-Bienko (1950) has suggested that the adaptation
of desert-inhabiting cockroaches to rodent burrows might enable
these insects to survive in the severe climatic conditions of deserts in
summer.</p>

<p>Under desert conditions in southern Arizona, the relative humidity
outside of the burrows of the kangaroo rat is 1 to 15 percent during
the day and 15 to 40 percent at night; but inside the burrows the relative
humidity is 30 to 50 percent, and the temperature, even during
the day, is below 30&deg; C. (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1949). Thus by living
in rodent burrows during the day and going outside at night, the desert
cockroaches could avail themselves of the most favorable microclimates
obtainable. Presumably whatever food these insects eat provides
them with sufficient water to enable them to survive under
desert conditions. Bodenheimer (1953) has suggested that the extent
of utilization of dew, which is sometimes heavy in the desert, should
be investigated; he stated that tenebrionid beetles have been seen in
the early morning eating dry [dead?] herbs that were still wet with
dew. It is obvious that there is a need for additional detailed information
without which we can only guess about the ecology of desert
cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pmb2">In the following list we have cited only those species that were
stated to have been found under desert conditions. Undoubtedly, related
species that have been taken in similar localities are also desert-inhabiting
forms, as, for example, other species of <i>Arenivaga</i> that
were collected in Texas by Hebard (1943a). In the absence of specific
information linking such other species with deserts, we have arbitrarily
relegated those forms to the section on outdoor habitats. In
addition to the species listed below, desert cockroaches are said to be
found in the following genera: <i>Anisogamia</i>, <i>Mononychoblatta</i>, and
<i>Nymphytria</i> (Chopard, 1938).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Turkmen S.S.R.</i>&mdash;Although this species is secondarily encountered
in dwellings and courtyards, it is a very characteristic insect of the
Trans-Caspian deserts; the females are encountered fairly frequently
as inhabitants of sand, where they run slowly over the surface, or dig
themselves into the sand to continue their forward motion not far
below the surface (Fausek, 1906). Uvarov (<i>in</i> Chopard, 1929b) indicated

<h3>AQUATIC HABITATS</h3>

<p>The so-called aquatic or amphibious cockroaches are all members
of the subfamily Epilamprinae (Chopard, 1938). These forms are
not nearly as aquatic as water beetles or aquatic Hemiptera, but in
their relations to water they behave differently from nonamphibious
cockroaches, which tend to avoid water except for drinking. There
are apparently no special morphological characteristics that distinguish
amphibious cockroaches (Shelford, 1907, 1909a; Chopard,
1938), although Takahashi (1926) listed several characters that he
considered made <i>Opisthoplatia maculata</i> adapted for an aquatic life:
(1) Back of body easily wetted; (2) long hairs on underside of
thorax trap air; (3) terminal abdominal spiracles open into tubes that
extend rearward; (4) long hairs on ventral surfaces of cerci "protect"
terminal abdominal spiracles. Annandale (1906) also suggested
that the position of the posterior abdominal spiracles, at the base of
tubes that project rearward from beneath the seventh tergite, are an
adaptation to an aquatic life. However, as Shelford (1907) and
Chopard (1938) have pointed out, this same feature may be observed
in many terrestrial cockroaches. The legs of amphibious cockroaches
are similar to those of nonaquatic species and are not modified for
swimming (Shelford, 1909a; Takahashi, 1926).</p>

<p class="pmb3">Biological observations have been made on relatively few species,
but representatives of at least six genera occur in quasi-aquatic habitats.
Strictly speaking, these cockroaches live on land at the edges of
streams or pools and spend relatively brief periods in the water. A
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
few species are found in water-filled bromeliads. The behavior of the
known amphibious species of cockroaches in relation to their habitats
is discussed below.</p>


<h3>AMPHIBIOUS COCKROACHES</h3>


<h4>Audreia bromeliadarum</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Panama.</i>&mdash;These insects when disturbed would dive into the water
that had collected in the base of the bromeliad; they would disappear
beneath the surface and remain submerged for some considerable
time (Caudell, 1914).</p>


<h4>Dryadoblatta scotti</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Trinidad.</i>&mdash;This species was taken from the leaf bases of <i>Tillandsia</i>
sp. at 3,100 feet; water had collected between the leaves and the
insect was presumed to be more or less amphibious (Scott, 1912).
Subaquatic in the bromeliad <i>Glomeropitcairnia erectiflora</i>: "This
large and handsome species [<i>D. scotti</i>] is very common in the larger,
water-filled, epiphytic bromeliads of the rain forest. Within these
plants it is usually to be found, often in considerable numbers, just
above the surface of the water or partly immersed in it. The cockroaches
will descend rapidly into the water when alarmed and probably
obtain their nourishment from the accumulated organic matter
in the water. Floating material is probably taken and it seems less
likely that they feed below the surface. They appear to be ovoviviparous."
(Princis and Kevan, 1955.)</p>


<h4>Epilampra abdomen-nigrum</h4>

<p><i>Puerto Rico.</i>&mdash;Abundant in wet "malojillo" meadows. The
nymphs swim easily and remain under water for long periods, as do
the adults (Se&iacute;n, 1923; Wolcott, 1950).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Panama.</i>&mdash;A swimming nymph, captured in a dipper with mosquito
larvae in a lagoon of the Rio Chilibre, was kept under observations in
an aquarium. If disturbed, the insect dived into the water from floating
vegetation and swam rapidly below the surface for a minute or
two. Finally becoming quiescent, the cockroach would then cling to
submerged roots; twice it remained still for 15 minutes before climbing
to the surface, where it remained for five or more minutes before
emerging completely (Crowell, 1946).</p>


<h4>Epilampra annandalei</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Lower Burma.</i>&mdash;One male and three nymphs were collected in the
Dawna Hills by Annandale who made the following observations:
"The wingless specimens were under stones in a jungle stream and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
behaved just as the one I obtained in Chota, Nagpur, did [Annandale,
1906]. The winged specimen was under a stone at the edge of the
stream, but swam readily. It did not seem so much at home in the
water, however, and apparently could not, owing to the wings, raise
the tip of its abdomen above the surface." (Shelford, 1909a.)</p>


<h4>Epilampra&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">sp.</span></h4>

<p><i>Siamese Malay States.</i>&mdash;Wingless females rested on floating logs
from which they would dive into the water upon the least disturbance;
they remained under water for several minutes, then surfaced beneath
the shelter of the log. In the jungle all females were taken either in
the water or among matted roots on the sides of the stream. Winged
males were seen rising from the surface of the water (Annandale,
1900).</p>

<p><i>Sarawak.</i>&mdash;All specimens were immature; they swam and dived
well, but were soon drowned if prevented from rising to the surface
to breathe. "When at rest the body of the cockroach is almost entirely
submerged, the tip of the abdomen alone projecting above the surface
of the water; the abdomen moves gently up and down and every
30-40 seconds a bubble of air issues from the prothoracic spiracle on
each side." (Shelford, 1901, 1916.)</p>

<p><i>India.</i>&mdash;A nymphal female, found in a jungle stream at Chota
Nagpur, could swim with belly or back upward. When held under
water it drowned in a few minutes. The tip of the abdomen was held
out of water (Annandale, 1906).</p>

<p class="pmb1">Shelford (1907) has suggested that the immature stages of terrestrial
species of <i>Epilampra</i> may well be amphibious. This is an area
that could profit by more field observations.</p>


<h4>Opisthoplatia maculata</h4>

<p><i>Formosa.</i>&mdash;Invariably found under or between rocks near mountain
streams. The wingless adult and the nymph have similar habits.
Normally the cockroach lives on land, and when it goes into the water
it returns to land within a few minutes. This cockroach rarely swims,
but when it does, it maintains its body in a horizontal position just
below the surface of the water. Ordinarily, it walks on the river
bottom or on water-covered rocks. This insect feeds on decayed leaves
and, according to Shikano, it will eat human feces. (Takahashi, 1926.)</p>

<p class="pmb1">This species has a large number of long hydrophobic hairs on the
ventral sides of the thorax and anterior abdominal segments. When
the insect submerges, air is trapped in these hairs. The thoracic and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
one pair of abdominal spiracles open into the bubble of trapped air.
However, the insect apparently does not use this plastron of air to
replenish its tracheal air supply, but, like <i>Rhicnoda natatrix</i> (see
below), it inspires air while at the surface through its posterior abdominal
spiracles and expires air into the bubble under the thorax.
While the insect is submerged, the air bubble increases in volume until
part of it breaks away and floats to the surface. (Takahashi, 1926.)</p>


<h4>Opisthoplatia orientalis</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Formosa.</i>&mdash;Lives on or in swampy ground (Takahashi, 1924).</p>


<h4>Rhicnoda natatrix</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Sarawak.</i>&mdash;Immature cockroaches were found in sodden leaves at
the edge of a pool, where they rested for hours at a time. Generally
the fore part of the body was in the water but the tip of the abdomen
was always in air. When disturbed the insects dived into the water
and hid under sticks and stones on the bottom. Air is inspired through
the posterior abdominal spiracles, when they projected above the
water surface, and expired through the thoracic spiracles. In experiments
in which the insects' abdomens were held immersed in water,
with the thorax exposed, the insects died in 6 to 12 hours or less. (Shelford,
1907.)</p>


<h4>Stictolampra buqueti concinula</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Westsumba.</i>&mdash;Found under moist fallen leaves on gravelly shore
of Melolo River. The nymphs distinguished themselves through their
amphibious mode of life and were often good swimmers (Princis,
1957a).</p>


<h4>Unidentified epilamprines</h4>

<p class="pmb3"><i>Brazil.</i>&mdash;These cockroaches were found under stones at the side
of a rocky stream at Ouro Preto. When disturbed they ran down
under the surface of the water and hid under stones at the bottom.
When thrown on the water surface, they were helpless, and to get
beneath the water surface they had to walk down some object. When
they had penetrated the surface film they could swim freely. Specimens
kept in jars lived several days with only a portion of their abdomens
exposed to the air. (Bristowe, 1925.)</p>


<h3>OUTDOOR HABITATS</h3>

<p>This category is a catchall for all cockroaches that are not limited
to the more circumscribed habitats that have been previously considered.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Some cockroaches in this section select specific microhabitats
(e.g., <i>Cryptocercus</i> spp., which live exclusively in rotten logs; and
<i>Neoblattella dryas</i>, <i>N. eurydice</i>, and <i>N. grossbecki</i> in bromeliads).
Others are found in a wide variety of habitats (e.g., <i>Ischnoptera
deropeltiformis</i> and <i>Parcoblatta</i> spp.). But some species are so little
known that their actual habitats are barely suggested in the collection
data.</p>

<p>Williams (1941) made an ecological study of the floor fauna of the
Panama rain forest. He found Orthoptera (nearly all were unidentified
nymphal cockroaches) in the litter of dead leaves, twigs, and other
plant products in over 90 percent of the quadrats he examined. These
insects represented about 0.25 percent of the total animal population.</p>

<p>Delamare Deboutteville (1948) made a quantitative study of the
animal population in suspended soil that had accumulated between the
roots of forest epiphytes of the lower Ivory Coast. He analyzed 2
dm.<sup>3</sup> samples of soil from an epiphyte located 45 meters above ground
on a main branch of <i>Parinarium</i>, with these results: <i>Horizon A.</i>&mdash;Superficial
zone of large rootlets, 6 cm. deep: 2 cockroaches, 4 arachnids,
and 4 beetles. <i>Horizon B.</i>&mdash;Zone of fine rootlets, 6 cm. deep:
6 cockroaches and numerous other arthropods. <i>Horizon C.</i>&mdash;Humid
zone, 8 cm. deep: 7 cockroaches and numerous other arthropods.
Plants, such as <i>Palissota</i>, were also living in this very original biotype.</p>

<p>The species of cockroaches listed below have been found in the
following kinds of outdoor microhabitats: In jungle, forest, and
woodlands they have been found in rotten wood; under bark of living,
dead, and fallen trees; in decay cavities in trees; burrowing in living
bark; on foliage of trees, shrubs, bushes, and low herbage; on vines
and in bromeliads and epiphytic ferns; under signs on trees and
stumps; in piles of logs and firewood; under dead leaves and debris;
in and under decaying fruit on the ground. Cockroaches have been
found between the leaves and under leaf sheaths of sugarcane, corn,
and other grasses; under dry fibers and fronds of coconut trees; in
hollow stems and bases of tree-fern fronds; under bracts of banana
blossoms and in bunches of bananas (p. <a href="#Page_146">146</a>). Cockroaches also inhabit
abandoned cocoons and larval tents, wasp nests, ant nests, termite
nests, bird nests, rat nests, and burrows of other rodents (pp. 23-25,
310-319). Cockroaches have been found in rock crevices and
under rocks; under boards and other objects on ground; under seaweed,
drift, and other debris on beaches; burrowing in soil and under
clods of earth; in marshes and swamps; in dumps and rubbish heaps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb2">The above list does not exhaust the available outdoor microhabitats
that cockroaches find suitable for their continued existence, but it is
fairly representative. Although we have no measurements to substantiate
this conclusion, we suggest that the microhabitats cited above
have a more constant temperature and a relatively higher humidity
than is provided by the surrounding macrohabitats. We would expect
insects such as cockroaches, whose water balance is dependent
on a continuous supply of fluid water or moist food, to seek moist
environments or to avoid situations in which their transpiration might
increase. Deviations, presumably brief, from this expected behavior
must occur to account for the cockroaches that are found under relatively
unfavorable environmental conditions. Despite the apparent
preference for cryptic habitats, some cockroaches are found in hot
sunlight (<i>Ellipsidion</i> spp.; Tepper, 1893); Rehn (1945) has stated
that many kinds are diurnal rather than nocturnal. Movement of
cockroaches between habitats may be assumed to occur; but movement
from an unfavorable environment to a more favorable one,
following a shift in water balance, has not been observed in nature;
however, laboratory experiments suggest that the mechanism for
mediating such behavior is present in some species of cockroaches
(Gunn and Cosway, 1938; Roth and Willis, 1952a). Obviously, additional
research is needed on the bionomics of all species. Further conclusions
based on current limited knowledge can only be speculative
and possibly misleading.</p>

<p><i>Florida.</i>&mdash;"The almost impenetrable jungle on Key Largo was examined,
and in its depths the two specimens of this species were secured
by beating the lower branches of gumbo limbo, other trees and
the lower bushes and shrubs, among which latter are to be found such
tropical forms as <i>Ocotea catesbyana</i> [= <i>Nectandra coriacea</i>] and

<h4>Comptolampra liturata</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Malaya.</i>&mdash;Often found between dry foliage in the beakers of the
epiphytic fern, <i>Asplenium nidus</i>, although the species lives mainly in
bamboo bushes (Karny, 1924).</p>


<h4>Cryptocercus punctulatus</h4>

<p><i>North Carolina.</i>&mdash;"They were never found except in parts of the
logs [chestnut] where the decayed wood was soft, punky and wet"
(Rehn and Hebard, 1910).</p>

<p><i>Oregon.</i>&mdash;In fir logs where sap wood was soggy (Hebard, 1917).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Appalachian Mountains, U.S.</i>&mdash;In southern Virginia and eastern
Tennessee, it is usually quite abundant in well-forested areas at elevations
from 3,000 to 5,000 feet; "sometimes even a majority of the
dead logs on a mountain side have roaches in them" (Cleveland et al.,
1934). This cockroach not only lives in rotten, dead logs but also in
sound logs that have been down only a few years. In Virginia it is
found more often in chestnut and hemlock. "It occurs fairly often in
oak, and has been found in pine, spruce, and arbor vitae.... There
is little evidence that they ever leave the log and enter the ground"
(Cleveland et al., 1934).</p>

<p><i>Hawaii.</i>&mdash;"Crowds of these insects in various stages of development
sometimes gather in cypress trees, in suitable chinks, in old flowerhead
sheaths of palms, etc., and even more or less openly on leafy
twigs, in bunch grass, and the species is at times locally abundant
behind the older leaf bases of sugar cane" (Williams et al., 1931).
Williams also lists the following as food plants: <i>Cryptomeria</i>,
algaroba, lime trees, ripening mangoes, papayas, and oranges. However,
Bianchi (personal communication, 1954) doubted that any of
the above are the main dietary, because the largest populations he had
seen "were found in the fairly dry litter of Star Jasmine (<i>Jasminum
pubescens</i> Willd.), well removed from any of the plants mentioned
by Williams."</p>

fields of young crops and also in young geological strata in sections
with virgin soil. The populations of this steppe cockroach average
6 to 8 individuals per square meter from the middle to the end of
July. By the end of summer most individuals were observed at the

A nonexhaustive list of such structures would include dwellings,
restaurants, mess halls, barracks, groceries, markets, bakeries, dairies,
drug stores, department stores, hotels, hospitals, warehouses, mills,
factories, packing houses, animal houses, breweries, incinerators,
privies, sewers, sewage treatment plants, ships, aircraft, etc. Although
dwellings are only one of the many kinds of structures that are
colonized by cockroaches, the several species that have adopted this
mode of life are generally referred to as domiciliary cockroaches. This
term is adequate only if we remember that these cockroaches are not
restricted to domiciles but are pests in other structures as well.</p>

<p>Associations between man and certain species of cockroaches possibly
started as casually as the short-lived association that Beebe
(1953) observed when he discovered three cockroaches in the newly
built couch of an orang-utan. Obviously, when man came down from
the trees, his fellow travelers found his cave dwellings and other
abodes particularly favorable habitats. From such primitive beginnings,
domiciliary cockroaches have spread into every kind of structure
that man has since devised. We predict that when man develops a
suitable vehicle, cockroaches will someday accompany him into space.
Yet despite the apparent predilection of certain species of cockroaches
for man, man is only incidental to these associations. Only the shelter
and food that man unwittingly provides for these unwelcome guests
attract cockroaches to him; man's physical presence is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, of the common domiciliary cockroaches apparently
originated in the Tropics or sub-Tropics from whence they have
spread, through normal commercial channels, into most of the inhabited
world. At least eight domiciliary cockroaches originated in
Africa (Rehn, 1945): <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Blattella germanica</i>, <i>Leucophaea
maderae</i>, <i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i>, <i>Oxyhaloa buprestoides</i>, <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>, <i>P. australasiae</i>, and <i>Supella supellectilium</i>; and,
perhaps, <i>Periplaneta brunnea</i> as well; <i>Neostylopyga rhombifolia</i> was
probably of Indo-Malayan origin; <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> was of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
oriental origin; and <i>Leurolestes pallidus</i> was endemic in the West
Indies (Rehn, 1945). Princis (1954a) rejected Africa as the original
home of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and advanced reasons for placing its origin
in Central Asia.</p>

<p>Several domiciliary species have become well established in temperate
zones and some even in the Arctic. Bei-Bienko (1950) listed
the following 10 species as sinanthropes in the Palearctic zone: <i>Blatta
lateralis</i>, <i>B. orientalis</i>, <i>Blattella germanica</i>, <i>Leucophaea maderae</i>, <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>, <i>P. australasiae</i>, <i>Polyphaga saussurei</i>, <i>Pycnoscelus
surinamensis</i>, and <i>Supella supellectilium</i>. In the warmer parts of the
temperate regions, as in their native Tropics, certain domiciliary
species breed outdoors as well as indoors. In the less temperate
extensions of their ranges most domiciliary species are nearly always
found indoors. In regions with low winter temperatures these cockroaches
do not survive in unheated structures; but in heated buildings
<i>Blattella germanica</i>, for example, has been able to withstand the
rigorous climate of Alaska, where it has caused severe infestations
(Chamberlin, 1949).</p>

<p>The limiting factors that determine whether man-made structures
will provide suitable habitats for cockroaches are favorable temperature
and availability of water and food. The range of temperatures
that man provides for his own comfort and protection fosters the rapid
increase of cockroach populations indoors. Gunn (1934, 1935) has
demonstrated that the preferred temperature range (zone of indifference)
of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> is 20-29&deg; C. The upper limit of the preferred
temperature of <i>Blattella germanica</i> and <i>Periplaneta americana</i>
is 33&deg; C. (Gunn, 1935). The lower limits of temperature tolerance
were not sharply defined in Gunn's work. However, less than optimum
temperatures, if they last for only short periods, are not necessarily
lethal. The 24-hour mortality for <i>P. americana</i> that had been held for
one hour at 0&deg; C. was only 2&plusmn;2 percent (Knipling and Sullivan,
1957). Gunn (1934) observed that <i>Blatta orientalis</i> would not settle
at temperatures above 33&deg; C. and would react violently against higher
temperatures (e.g., 39&deg; C.) by running away; thus the thermotactic
behavior of cockroaches might be presumed to bring them into favorable
environments within structures. Thermal death points have been
determined for the above three species by Gunn and Notley (1936).</p>

<p>It is common knowledge among those who rear cockroaches experimentally
that, unless the water content of the food is high, fluid water
is essential in the insects' dietary. Ten species of domiciliary cockroaches
have been shown to be unable to survive as long on dry food
alone as they could on food and water at 36-40 percent relative
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
humidity (Willis and Lewis, 1957). <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, when in a state
of normal water balance, usually spent more time in the drier part of a
humidity gradient; but desiccated insects tended to become hygropositive
(Gunn and Cosway, 1938). We presume that other domiciliary
species behave similarly. If water is available nearby, it may
be presumed that partially desiccated cockroaches could locate a
source through the mediation of a humidity sense. Hygroreceptors
have been demonstrated on the antennae of <i>Blattella germanica</i> (Roth
and Willis, 1952a) and suggested for <i>Blatta orientalis</i> (Gunn and
Cosway, 1938).</p>

<p>Drinking water is available to cockroaches in the traps of sinks,
wash basins, tubs, and toilet bowls; in flush tanks; as condensation
on cold pipes, flush tanks, and windows; around leaking pipes and
faucets; as spillage; in miscellaneous water-filled containers, such as
pet drinking dishes, aquaria, vases; empty beverage bottles; and
drainage from ice boxes. Soft, juicy fruits and vegetables can provide
both moisture and food. There seems to be a tendency for certain
species (<i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Blattella germanica</i>) to become established
in the more humid parts of structures, such as basements,
around sinks, and in bathrooms. Whether this is a reaction to a
preferred humidity or merely a fortuitous aggregation near sources of
drinking water and food has never been clearly demonstrated. The
rather widespread dissemination of these species into zones of low
as well as high humidity suggests that detailed studies of the microclimatic
conditions of structural microhabitats will be needed before
meaningful conclusions can be drawn about the stratification of cockroaches
within structures according to species.</p>

<p>In nearly all structures infested by cockroaches, food of some kind
is available, either in the structure itself or nearby. This may be the
food stored by man for his own use or the use of kept animals; it may
be crumbs, food spillage, garbage, or excreta; glues and pastes on
cartons, boxes, stamps, envelopes, labels, and wall paper; sizing on
cloth and book covers; various dried animal and plant products; dead
insects; living plants; etc. In fact, it is almost impossible, despite good
housekeeping, to keep any structure used by man free of all food
suitable for cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pmb3">That the requisite temperature, water, and food are provided, more
or less adequately, by a variety of structures is attested by the
innumerable infestations of cockroaches that develop when control
measures are relaxed. Within structures the accessibility of certain
harborages to cockroaches probably depends on the habits of the
species and to some extent on their size. Similar types of harborages
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in different structures may be used by the same species, although there
seems to be some overlapping by different species into the same kinds
of daytime shelters. The comparative ecology of domiciliary cockroaches
has not been thoroughly investigated, so any interpretation of
observational data is necessarily speculative and inconclusive at this
time. Our discussion on pages 324 to 343 is also pertinent to this
section.</p>


<h3>LAND-BASED STRUCTURES</h3>

<p>Dwellings provide a variety of microhabitats that are acceptable to
cockroaches. It has been stated that old houses, or houses that have
many cracks and crevices, or have basement kitchens that are not kept
clean and in good repair are particularly liable to invasion by cockroaches
(Laing, 1946; British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951). Although
this statement is undoubtedly true, it has been our personal experience,
as well as the experience of others, that new, clean, and well-planned
houses and apartments are also easily and sometimes quickly invaded
by cockroaches. Mallis (1954) has cited the following places that are
frequently infested by cockroaches in homes. In the kitchen, cockroaches
are found in and around sinks, in cupboards above and below
sinks, under tables and chairs, in stoves, around breadboards, in utility
cabinets, in kitchen closets, under linoleum, behind, under, and inside
refrigerators and iceboxes. In living rooms cockroaches are found in
furniture, studio couches, sewing machines, closets, and bookshelves;
behind picture frames, pennants, calendars, and other wall ornaments.
In bathrooms cockroaches are found in and behind utility cabinets
and toilets; they may be found in wicker clothes hampers, in brooms
and mops, and in door hinges. Ordinarily, cockroaches are not found
in bedrooms unless they are abundant elsewhere in the dwelling.
Additional harborages are cited under specific cockroaches in the list
below.</p>

<p>In markets DeLong (1948) found the German cockroach in bags
of potatoes and onions, in crates of citrus fruits, in pads and shredded
papers in banana boxes, and in cases of bottled beverages. The insects
were attracted by coffee and crawled into the folds of coffee bags.
They were found in cartons of canned goods; in bread and baked
goods; in cartons of packaged cookies, cakes, and crackers. Packaged
cereals were attractive, and cockroaches were sometimes found in
packages of cigarettes. The insects occurred in scales (by the hundreds)
and in cash registers. Rather heavy infestations were found
under stainless-steel cappings that covered wooden arms on the fish
cleaning stand. The insects were numerous in display cases where
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
they were warm and sheltered. They were also found behind mirrors
above produce racks, in electrical switch boxes and conduits, and in
telephone boxes, as well as generally in cracks and behind loose
moldings or loose wall boards. Enclosed boxlike tables were frequently
heavily infested.</p>

<p>In restaurants cockroaches may be found in the following places:
Crevices in wood, plaster, concrete, and metal; in the bar; in the
kitchen and in the associated equipment; in cupboards, lavatories,
and garbage storage areas; and on the undersides of chairs and
tables (Mallis, 1954).</p>

<p>In drug stores Frings (1948) found cockroaches behind the mirror
and between the sink and the cooler. Thousands were found in hollow
ornamental shelf edging. The hollow bases of malted-milk dispensers
and drink mixers were cockroach havens.</p>

<p>In a hospital Frings (1948) found cockroaches in decorative trim
around doorways, by the thousands in wicker laundry baskets, and
in incubators for premature babies. In military hospitals we have
seen cockroaches (<i>Blattella germanica</i>) in kitchens and dining halls
in the usual hiding places mentioned above and on the undersides of
stainless-steel serving tables.</p>

<p>In department stores cockroaches have been found in food departments,
beauty salons, rest rooms, dressing rooms, linen departments,
and stationery departments (Anonymous, 1952). The infestation in
the linen department was traced to clean towels which, when returned
from the laundry, contained at least 500 cockroaches per bundle. The
insects were carried into the rest rooms and beauty salon when the
towels were distributed.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The microhabitats of cockroaches in privies and sewers have not
been studied. These habitats are particularly important in view of
the demonstrated migrations of cockroaches from sewers into dwellings
and the possible dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms
from feces to food. The reader is referred to our 1957(a) paper for
a summary of the known information on cockroach dispersal from
sewers.</p>


<h3>COCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH LAND-BASED STRUCTURES</h3>

<p class="pmb1">Most of the cockroaches listed below are either known domiciliary
species or they have been found one or more times in houses or other
man-made structures. The known structural pests breed within the
building. Certain other species, which have been observed only infrequently
in structures and are not known to breed there, may possibly
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
be incipient pests; these latter species may attain future economic
importance if they establish breeding colonies within a structure. A
few species have undoubtedly wandered indoors by accident. It is
difficult to decide whether a particular species was an accidental invader
or whether it was attracted indoors in response to some stimulus.
Only additional information will provide the desired answers.</p>


<h4>Aglaopteryx ypsilon</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Trinidad.</i>&mdash;Male found indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955).</p>


<h4>Allacta similis</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Hawaii.</i>&mdash;Found only indoors at Nauhi. Otherwise this is apparently
an outdoor species (Swezey and Williams, 1932).</p>


<h4>Blaberus craniifer</h4>

<p><i>Cuba.</i>&mdash;Household pest (Deschapelles, 1939). Particularly abundant
in houses in Santiago and Havana (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Florida.</i>&mdash;Under boards in woodshed (Rehn and Hebard, 1912,
1914).</p>


<h4>Blaberus discoidalis</h4>

<p><i>Ecuador.</i>&mdash;In eating places (Campos R., 1926).</p>

<p><i>Hispaniola.</i>&mdash;In houses (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).</p>

<p><i>New Jersey.</i>&mdash;In greenhouse (Weiss, 1917).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Puerto Rico.</i>&mdash;In homes (Se&iacute;n, 1923). In fruit stores (Wolcott,
1950).</p>


<h4>Blatta lateralis</h4>

<p><i>Central Asia.</i>&mdash;Household pest, often found in homes with clay
floors (Bei-Bienko, 1950).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Turkmen S.S.R.</i>&mdash;Males and females occurred in dwellings
(Vlasov, 1929).</p>


<h4>Blatta orientalis</h4>

<p class="pmb1">This species is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917;
Rehn, 1945). It is reported to occur particularly in basements and
crawl spaces under basementless houses (Mallis, 1954). In damp
basements where food is available large colonies are not unusual, but
it also may infest offices and apartments several floors off the ground
(Gould and Deay, 1940). The number encountered on upper floors
is seldom large, but the frequency of occurrence may reach 30 percent
of the observations (Spear et al., <i>in</i> Shuyler, 1956). In supermarkets
this species hides during the day inside concrete blocks or cracks in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the foundation, under furniture, or behind cartons; it is conspicuous
on the floors of the markets at night (De Long, 1948). In Great
Britain the kitchen is preferred by this pest (and by <i>Blattella germanica</i>);
they shelter beneath steam radiators and gas stoves, behind
hot-water pipes, underneath furniture and floor coverings, sinks and
baths; basements and underground kitchens are especially likely to be
infested (Laing, 1946; British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951). Goodliffe
(1958) noted that <i>B. orientalis</i> may travel long distances to find
food.</p>


<h4>Blattella germanica</h4>

<p>This species is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917;
Rehn, 1945). It is one of the commonest insects in homes and
restaurants (Gould and Deay, 1940). It is found in kitchens, larders,
bathrooms, furnace rooms, and storage rooms of bakeries, breweries,
hospitals, barracks, as well as dwellings, where, during daylight, it
hides behind cupboards, furniture, hanging pictures, panels and
skirting boards, in cracks around drains, water pipes, electric wires,
and hot-water and steam heating units (Wille, 1920). The German
cockroach may be found in cracks around baseboards, pipes, conduits,
sinks, and drawers; behind cabinets; inside switch boxes and refrigerators;
on under surfaces of tables, chairs, and shelves; between
stacks of stored goods, and in almost every place that is not readily
observed (Kruse, 1948). We have also seen this species packed in
electric-clock cases and loud-speaker baffles, in cash registers, and
clinging to the undersurface of stainless-steel steam tables. The
infestation of markets by this species has been described above. Very
narrow cracks provide refuges for the German cockroach. Wille
(1920) found first-instar nymphs in cracks 0.5 mm. wide and adult
males and females without o&ouml;thecae in cracks 1.6 mm. wide.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Shuyler (1956) has observed extensions into relatively new structural
habitats by <i>Blattella germanica</i> in the north-central area of the
United States. A few German cockroaches are now being encountered
in living rooms, bedrooms, clothes closets, bedroom furniture, lobbies,
entrance halls, checkrooms, nonfood storerooms, nonfood warehouses,
and coin-vending machine repair shops. In these situations
this species is behaving much like the brown-banded cockroach,
<i>Supella supellectilium</i>.</p>


<h4>Blattella schubotzi</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Cameroon.</i>&mdash;Five specimens in a house (Princis, 1955).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>


<h4>Blattella vaga</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>U.S.A.</i>&mdash;Although this is mostly an outdoor species, during dry
seasons it may temporarily enter houses in great numbers, occasionally
breeding indoors in Arizona (Flock, 1941a). Two adults were collected
indoors in Texas (Riherd, 1953).</p>


<h4>Chromatonotus notatus</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Trinidad.</i>&mdash;A male was found indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955).</p>


<h4>Cutilia soror</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Hawaii.</i>&mdash;Almost as common in houses as <i>Neostylopyga rhombifolia</i>
(Hebard, 1922).</p>


<h4>Ectobius duskei</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>U.S.S.R.</i>&mdash;Frequently occurs in living apartments in farming localities
as an accidental inhabitant (Bei-Bienko, 1950).</p>


<h4>Ectobius pallidus</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Massachusetts.</i>&mdash;A summertime pest in houses along coast (Gurney,
1953; E. R. Willis, personal observation). Generally an outdoor
species.</p>


<h4>Epilampra abdomen-nigrum</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Trinidad.</i>&mdash;Male, indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955). An outdoor
species generally.</p>


<h4>Ergaula capensis</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Cameroon.</i>&mdash;A male taken in a house (Princis, 1955).</p>


<h4>Eublaberus posticus</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Trinidad.</i>&mdash;Indoors, feeding on bat feces (Princis and Kevan,
1955).</p>


<h4>Eurycotis floridana</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Florida.</i>&mdash;Occasionally found in homes (Creighton, 1954; Roth
and Willis, 1954a).</p>


<h4>Euthyrrhapha pacifica</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Hawaii.</i>&mdash;Found outdoors and indoors where it breeds in neglected
cupboards and in rubbish (Fullaway and Krauss, 1945).</p>


<h4>Holocompsa azteca</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Mexico.</i>&mdash;Household pest (Ball et al., 1942).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>


<h4>Holocompsa cyanea</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Costa Rica.</i>&mdash;One specimen in house (Rehn, 1906).</p>


<h4>Holocompsa nitidula</h4>

<p class="pmb1">Apparently domiciliary in American Tropics (Hebard, 1917). In
houses under chests, etc., Cuba (Gundlach, 1890-1891); Puerto Rico
(Gundlach, 1887). In folds of burlap bag, Florida (Rehn and
Hebard, 1914).</p>


<h4>Ischnoptera rufa occidentalis</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Panama.</i>&mdash;Thrives about human habitations under litter, though
not domiciliary (Hebard, 1920).</p>


<h4>Ischnoptera rufa rufa</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Jamaica.</i>&mdash;In hotel. "While hardly a domiciliary form it would
seem to frequent environments where man has considerably disturbed
natural conditions, as under debris, docks, under logs and stones in
cultivated areas" (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).</p>


<h4>Leucophaea maderae</h4>

<p><i>West Indies.</i>&mdash;In habitations, warehouses, and other structures;
"At times it is a very abundant and serious pest" (Rehn, 1945). In
Puerto Rico it was also found in fruit stores, markets, and inns (Se&iacute;n,
1923; Wolcott, 1950).</p>

<p class="pmb1">Reported as a domiciliary pest in Madeira (Heer, 1864); Windward
Islands (Marshall, 1878); Tropics and sub-Tropics (Rehn,
1937); Philippine Islands (Uichanco, 1953); New York City (Anonymous,
1953; Gurney, 1953); Trinidad (Princis and Kevan, 1955).
This species is also established in coastal Brazil, Central America,
all the Greater Antilles, several other tropical islands, and tropical
Africa, where it probably originated (Rehn, 1945).</p>


<h4>Leurolestes circumvagans</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Hispaniola, Grenada.</i>&mdash;Largely domiciliary (Rehn and Hebard,
1927).</p>


<h4>Leurolestes pallidus</h4>

<p><i>Cuba.</i>&mdash;All over island, in houses, under lockers, etc. (Rehn, 1945;
Gundlach, 1890-1891).</p>

<p><i>Florida.</i>&mdash;Rehn and Hebard (1914).</p>

<p class="pmb1">This species has been recorded from various islands in the West
Indies, from Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil (Rehn, 1945).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>


<h4>Methana marginalis</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Australia.</i>&mdash;Reported entering houses (Pope, 1953a).</p>


<h4>Nauphoeta cinerea</h4>

<p><i>Australia.</i>&mdash;In hospital (Mackerras and Mackerras, 1948). In
dwellings, grain stores, and fowl-feeding pens (Pope, 1953).</p>

<p><i>Sudan.</i>&mdash;Domiciliary in huts of the Shilluk natives; fairly widely
distributed in eastern Africa (Rehn, 1945).</p>

<p><i>Hawaii.</i>&mdash;In feed rooms of poultry plants (Illingworth, 1942).</p>

<p><i>Florida.</i>&mdash;Established in feed mills around Tampa (Gresham, 1952;
Gurney, 1953).</p>

<p class="pmb1">The wide distribution of this species from East Africa, where it
originated, to the Orient and the New World was undoubtedly
mediated by shipping (Rehn, 1945).</p>


<h4>Neoblattella&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">sp.</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Puerto Rico.</i>&mdash;Observed [as <i>Blatta caraibea</i>, Rehn and Hebard
(1927)] in houses (Gundlach, 1887).</p>


<h4>Neostylopyga rhombifolia</h4>

<p class="pmb1">Domiciliary in Indo-Malaya and New World Tropics (Rehn,
1945); Philippine Islands (Uichanco, 1953); and Hawaii (Hebard,
1922).</p>


<h4>Oxyhaloa buprestoides</h4>

<p class="pmb1">Presumably to some extent domiciliary, as it evidently spread from
Africa to the New World via slave ships (Rehn and Hebard, 1927;
Rehn, 1945).</p>


<h4>Panchlora nivea</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Colombia.</i>&mdash;A male and a female taken in a dwelling (Princis,
1946). This is primarily an outdoor species which is frequently taken
indoors as an adventive on bananas (see p. 150 for references).</p>


<h4>Parcoblatta fulvescens</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Florida.</i>&mdash;Males found in laboratory and dormitory buildings,
ostensibly attracted by lights (Friauf, 1953).</p>


<h4>Parcoblatta lata</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Connecticut.</i>&mdash;Domiciliary pest (Moore, 1957). Generally an outdoor
species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>


<h4>Parcoblatta notha</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Arizona.</i>&mdash;It may occasionally be a nuisance in houses (Ball et al.,
1942).</p>


<h4>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</h4>

<p><i>U.S.A.</i>&mdash;Country houses often badly infested, Indiana (Blatchley,
1920). Frequently taken in houses in wooded areas, Michigan (Hubbell,
1922). Infestation by males, females, and nymphs on fourth
floor of building, South Dakota (Severin, 1952). Houses in wooded
areas infested by nymphs and occasionally by adults (Gould and
Deay, 1940).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Canada.</i>&mdash;Pest in summer cottages in Ontario (Walker, 1912).</p>


<h4>Periplaneta americana</h4>

<p class="pmb1">This is a cosmopolitan domiciliary pest (Hebard, 1917; Rehn,
1945). It is common in restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and
where food is prepared or stored; it was trapped regularly in the
basement and upper floors of store buildings, and it was also found
in all heated parts of an old meat-packing plant (Gould and Deay,
1938). <i>P. americana</i> was numerous in latrines in Iran (Bei-Bienko,
1950) and in privies in Texas (Dow, 1955) and Georgia (Haines
and Palmer, 1955). Large numbers of this species also occur in
sewers adjacent to human habitations (Roth and Willis, 1957a).</p>


<h4>Periplaneta australasiae</h4>

<p>Generally domiciliary, but also occurs outdoors in the West Indies
(Rehn and Hebard, 1927). It is a very abundant domiciliary pest in
tropical Africa and tropical America (Rehn, 1945); Ecuador (Campos
R., 1926); Puerto Rico (Sein, 1923); Philippine Islands
(Uichanco, 1953); Australia (Pope, 1953).</p>

<p class="pmb1">Also occurs as a pest in greenhouses in Pennsylvania (Thilow and
Riley, 1891); France (Giard, 1900); Italy (Boettger, 1930); Great
Britain (Laing, 1946; British Museum [Nat. Hist.], 1951).</p>


<h4>Periplaneta brunnea</h4>

<p class="pmb1">Circumtropical domiciliary pest which is apparently more nearly
peculiar to the Tropics and adjacent regions than <i>P. americana</i>
(Hebard, 1917). This species has been trapped in significant numbers
in privies and dwellings in Georgia (Haines and Palmer, 1955). It is
the species of <i>Periplaneta</i> present in homes in San Antonio, Texas
(Mallis, 1954).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>


<h4>Periplaneta fuliginosa</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>U.S.A.</i>&mdash;Frequently encountered out of doors, but has been reported
common after dark about a hotel in Alabama and was captured
in a house in Louisiana; it was also extremely abundant on the
wharves at night in Jacksonville, Florida (Hebard, 1917). As a
domiciliary pest it was, next to <i>Blattella germanica</i>, the most common
cockroach inside homes in southwest Georgia, where it was also the
most common cockroach in privies (Haines and Palmer, 1955). This
species has become a very common domiciliary pest in Texas (Eads,
personal communication, 1955). It infested a greenhouse for five
years in Indiana (Gould and Deay, 1940).</p>


<h4>Periplaneta ignota</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Australia.</i>&mdash;It occurs in dwellings occasionally (Pope, 1953).</p>


<h4>Phaetalia pallida</h4>

<p><i>Colombia.</i>&mdash;Three specimens from three dwellings (Princis, 1946).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Trinidad.</i>&mdash;Male indoors; male and female at light (Princis and
Kevan, 1955).</p>


<h4>Plectoptera dorsalis</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Puerto Rico.</i>&mdash;According to Gundlach (1887) it enters houses at
night attracted by light (Rehn and Hebard, 1927).</p>


<h4>Polyphaga aegyptiaca</h4>

<p><i>Iraq.</i>&mdash;Common in houses (Weber, 1954).</p>

<p><i>Caucasus.</i>&mdash;Winged male in kitchen (Burr, 1913).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>U.S.S.R.</i>&mdash;Listed as a sinanthrope (Bei-Bienko, 1950).</p>


<h4>Polyphaga saussurei</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>South-central Asia.</i>&mdash;One of the commonest domiciliary species
(Bei-Bienko, 1950).</p>


<h4>Pseudophoraspis nebulosa</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>East Indies.</i>&mdash;This species is sometimes difficult indoors (Karny,
1925).</p>


<h4>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</h4>

<p class="pmb1">A household pest in the East Indies (Karny, 1925); Philippine
Islands (Uichanco, 1953); Tanganyika (Smith, 1955); Trinidad,
eight records indoors (Princis and Kevan, 1955). It is also a greenhouse
pest (Hebard, 1917; Zappe, 1918; Doucette and Smith, 1926;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Saupe, 1928; Roeser, 1940). Common in or around chicken batteries
and yards in Hawaii (Schwabe, 1949).</p>


<h4>Supella supellectilium</h4>

<p class="pmb1">Domiciliary wherever distributed (Rehn, 1945), this species is
especially difficult to control because of its apparently nonselective
dispersal throughout dwellings. For example, Mallis (1954) observed
in Texas that it was widely distributed throughout the apartment and
was probably the most common cockroach seen in the bedroom; its
favorite harborages were beneath and behind corner braces on kitchen
chairs, underneath tables, behind pictures and other objects on walls,
and in shower stalls; its o&ouml;thecae were commonly fastened on walls
and ceilings throughout the house. Gould and Deay (1940) reported
that this species prefers high locations, such as shelves in closets,
behind pictures, and picture molding; o&ouml;thecae were found about
kitchen sink, desks, tables, and other furniture, and even in bedding.
Hafez and Afifi (1956) stated that the adult wanders in nearly all
rooms of the house and only visits the kitchen when searching for
food; it hides in cupboards, pantries, closets, bookshelves, drawers,
and behind picture frames; the nymphs normally hide in the corners
of drawers, behind frames, and in similar situations.</p>


<h4>Symploce bicolor</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Puerto Rico.</i>&mdash;In houses, Sardinera Beach, Mona Island (Ramos,
1946).</p>


<h4>Symploce hospes</h4>

<p><i>North American Tropics.</i>&mdash;Domiciliary, but not exclusively so,
and apparently widely distributed (Hebard, 1917). In Florida, as
<i>Ischnoptera rufescens</i>, found in a greasy cupboard (Rehn and Hebard,
1914).</p>

<p class="pmb3"><i>Hawaii.</i>&mdash;Illingworth (1915).</p>


<h3>SHIPS</h3>

<p>Sailing ships have long been notorious for their unwelcome hordes
of cockroaches, and it was by ship that at least 11 domiciliary species
migrated from their centers of origin to other parts of the world
(Rehn, 1945). Over 40 nondomiciliary species have been carried by
ship from the American Tropics to other parts of the world in cargoes
of bananas (p. <a href="#Page_146">146</a>). In addition to these, other adventive cockroaches
appear from time to time in ports to which they have been carried by
ships. Yet by far the most numerous cockroaches on shipboard are
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the breeding populations of a few common domiciliary pests. Except
in the most rigorously disinsectized ships, this commerce in cockroaches
has continued to the present day.</p>

<p>Cockroaches undoubtedly infested the first ships that sailed the
Mediterranean; of these we have no records. The earliest recognizable
record of cockroaches on shipboard is Moffett's (1634) statement
that when Drake captured the ship <i>Philip</i>, he found it overrun
with cockroaches [<i>Blattarum alatarum</i>]. Bligh (1792) described disinfesting
H.M.S. <i>Bounty</i> with boiling water to kill cockroaches.
Chamisso (1829) reported that he had seen ships casks, in which rice
or grain had been stored, that were found to be filled with <i>Blattella
germanica</i> when opened. During a voyage from England to Van
Diemen's Land, Lewis (1836) was greatly annoyed by hundreds of
cockroaches flying about his cabin at night; the most numerous resembled
<i>Periplaneta americana</i> and another was similar to <i>Ectobius
lapponicus</i>. This latter was undoubtedly <i>B. germanica</i>, which is the
only ship-infesting species that resembles the feral <i>E. lapponicus</i>.
Lewis continued, <i>P. americana</i> "were in immense profusion, and had
communication with every part of the ship, between the timbers or
skin. The ravages they committed on everything edible were very
extensive; not a biscuit but was more or less polluted by them, and
amongst the cargo 300 cases of cheeses, which had holes in them to
prevent their sweating, were considerably damaged, some of them
being half devoured and not one without some marks of their residence."</p>

<p>Kingsley (1870), Kellogg (1908), Gates (1912), Heiser (1936),
and Bronson (1943) have all reported that cockroaches were so
numerous on ships that they gnawed the skin and nails of the men on
board. These are all independent observations of what may well have
been a common occurrence on ships. We have discussed in detail the
subject of cockroaches biting man in our 1957(a) paper.</p>

<p>Mosely (1892) reported, "At the time that England was left the
ship [H.M.S. <i>Challenger</i>] seemed nearly free of animals, other than
men, dogs, and livestock required for food. The first cockroaches
apparently came on board at St. Vincent, Cape Verdes.... Cockroaches
soon became plentiful on board, and showed themselves whenever
the ship was in a warm climate.</p>

<p>"At one period of the voyage, a number of these insects established
themselves in my cabin, and devoured parts of my boots, nibbling off
all the margins of leather projecting beyond the seams on the upper
leathers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Edmund Freemantle (1904) recalled some of his experiences
in the British Navy. "Cockroaches in the tropics were also terrible
scourges. One saw little of them in fine, dry weather, but in damp,
wet weather they seemed to come from every hidden corner ... our
remedy in the 'Spartan' was to make the boys catch them&mdash;on pain of
being caned.... One brig, the 'Lily,' was so overrun by cockroaches
that the officers' clothes smelt of them."</p>

<p>The quotation from Sonan (1924) on page 348 describes similar
conditions in the Japanese Navy.</p>

<p>On modern cargo ships cockroaches are reported to be extremely
numerous in the galley, the crew's quarters, and sometimes in the
holds; they dwell in hot, humid environments such as the casing
around steam pipes (Monro, 1951). Williams (1931) reported that
<i>Blattella germanica</i> was the most important cockroach pest on ships
seen at New York. Although often numerous in the holds, the cockroaches
as a rule congregated in living quarters. They were also
frequently found between tarpaulins covering the hatches. It was not
unusual to kill 20,000 to 50,000 in the forecastle, and more than 20,000
have been taken from a single stateroom. Simanton (1946) inspected
the S.S. <i>William Kieth</i> when it berthed at San Francisco from a
10-month voyage to the South Pacific. The holds were infested with
thousands of <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, but in the crew's quarters, mess
halls, and storerooms <i>B. germanica</i> predominated. After insecticidal
treatment about 2,000 <i>P. americana</i> were seen in each hold and as
many as 24 <i>B. germanica</i> in each cabin. Richardson (1947) reported
that in Army transports inspected between 1943 and 1946 at New
York, <i>P. americana</i> was found in the galleys and messes, and occasionally
heavy infestations were found deep in the holds; <i>B. germanica</i>
was found in the galleys and messes; <i>Blatta orientalis</i> was found only
in the hold.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Additional references indicating the presence of <i>Blattella germanica</i>
on ships may be found in the account of its parasite <i>Ripidius pectinicornis</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>). Although Rice (1925) and Williams (1931) cite
<i>B. germanica</i> as the most numerous cockroach on ships, Brooke
(1920) stated that the great majority of ship cockroaches were
<i>Periplaneta americana</i>. In addition to citing cockroach infestations
on ships, the following authors reported various methods for disinfecting
ships: Canalis (1916), Pryor (1918), Brooke (1920), Rice
(1925), Williams (1931), Simanton (1946), Richardson (1947), and
Anonymous (1951, 1954).</p>

<h3>COCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH SHIPS</h3>

<p>In the following list we include some previously unpublished data
on cockroaches that were recovered from ships at the Miami, Fla.,
Quarantine Station for the periods November 1945 through May
1946; May, June, August, and September 1950; and 17 July 1957
(Porter, personal communication, 1958). These data were lumped,
without breakdown to species, under the entry Orthoptera in Porter
(1958).</p>

<p class="pmb1">Certain of the species listed below occur only accidentally on shipboard
and will probably never establish breeding colonies on ships or
become pests on shipboard or elsewhere; some were merely passengers
between one land-based colony and another. Others, the truly
domiciliary pests, are as likely to be pests on shipboard as they are
in land-based structures.</p>

<h3>AIRCRAFT</h3>

<p>Michel (1935) stated that the development of air transportation
brought the same insect dispersal problems that exist in land and
water transportation; in addition, the problem of cockroach infestation
had become a very serious one, quite aside from the hygienic
point of view, because it had been discovered that these insects seek
out the wings of airplanes, where they subsisted on the glue and dope
used in airplane construction. However, Dethier (1945) found no
cockroaches in dismantled or wrecked wing and tail structures of
metal aircraft in central Africa. In fact, all-metal aircraft would seem
to provide little in the way of food or water for stowaway cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Laird (1951, 1952, 1956a) found living specimens of <i>Blattella
germanica</i>, <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, and <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> in
baggage compartments and/or kitchens in aircraft. Other species
which have been recovered from undisclosed spaces in aircraft are
listed below. Some of the cockroaches that were reported as dead may
not have died from exposure during flight but may have been killed by
insecticide applied by inspecting personnel at the airports.</p>

<h3>COCKROACHES ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT</h3>

<p>In the following list we include some previously unpublished data
on cockroaches that were recovered from aircraft in Miami, Fla.,
International Airport from 1 July 1956 through 30 June 1957 (Porter,
personal communication, 1958). These data were lumped under the
entry Orthoptera without breakdown to species in Porter (1958).</p>

<p>Species reported by Hughes (1949), and cited below as from southern
United States, were recovered from aircraft that arrived at
Brownsville, Fort Worth, Miami, New Orleans, and San Juan. There
was no way of linking a specific record with any particular city.</p>

<div class="chapter-beginning"> </div>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="IV_CLASSIFICATION_OF_THE_ASSOCIATIONS">IV. CLASSIFICATION OF THE ASSOCIATIONS</a></h2>


<p>Asano (1937) classified the natural enemies of cockroaches into
two types as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="p_sp03">1. Enemies that feed mainly on cockroaches (certain ripiphorid beetles and
      certain chalcid, evaniid, and ampulicid wasps).</p>

    <p class="p_sp03">2. Organisms which, in their search for food, devour cockroaches that may be
      encountered (certain species of scorpions, spiders, ticks, centipedes, Strepsiptera,
      ants, birds, rats, and "parasitic bacteria").</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p2">Cameron (1955) arranged the associates of cockroaches in two
groups as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="p_sp03">Group A. Parasites and predators.</p>

      <p class="p_sp04">1. Parasites: Hymenoptera (Evaniidae, Eulophidae, Eupelmidae, Encyrtidae,
        Pteromalidae, Cleonymidae) and Coleoptera (Ripiphoridae).</p>

      <p class="p_sp04">2. Predators: Hymenoptera (Ampulicidae), Hemiptera (Reduviidae), Coleoptera
        (Dermestidae), Arachnida (Araneae, Acarina).<br /><br /></p>

    <p class="p_sp03">Group B. Parasites and symbionts.</p>

      <p class="p_sp04">1. Protozoa (including examples of both parasites and commensals).</p>

      <p class="p_sp04">2. Nematoda (including both primary "parasites" and secondary parasites).</p>

      <p class="p_sp04">3. Bacteria (including the mutualistic bacteroids).</p>

      <p class="p_sp04 pmb2">4. Algae [<i>Arthromitis</i> (= <i>Hygrocrocis</i>) <i>intestinalis</i>; see p. 124].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asano's arrangement, although essentially true, is limited; Cameron's
system is divided into arthropods (group A) and lower
forms (group B), but does not include higher animals. Both attempts
at classification need amplification; this we have endeavored to do
below.</p>

<p>In classifying the biotic associates of cockroaches, we were immediately
confronted with a problem in semantics. The concepts
parasitism, predatism, and symbiosis have all been used with various
shades of meaning by different authors. The problem is not solved
merely by accepting as authoritative specific definitions, however apt
they seem to be, because, unfortunately, these concepts are not mutually
exclusive. For example, among the entomophagous insects, as
Sweetman (1936) has pointed out, there can be no definite line of
separation between parasitism and predatism: the two intergrade,
only the extremes being quite distinct. In fact, Andrewartha and
Birch (1954) generalized these relationships by calling both categories
predatism. These authors divided natural populations of
associated organisms into nonpredators and predators. Although this
simplifies their presentation of the general principles of ecology, for
our purpose more narrowly defined terms have proved useful.</p>

<p>In the main we have followed Sweetman (1936) and Allee et al.
(1949) in arriving at the following definitions:</p>

<p><b>Symbiosis</b> is the living together in more or less intimate association
of organisms of different species; it includes virtually all relationships
between cockroaches and other organisms, such as parasitism,
predatism, commensalism, and mutualism. Allee et al. (1949)
apparently do not include predatism in symbiosis.</p>

<p><b>Mutualism</b> is symbiosis in which both members benefit by the
association. The smaller partner has commonly been called a symbiont
or symbiote by authors.</p>

<p><b>Commensalism</b> includes associations in which neither party appears
to benefit or be harmed. One partner may live on the surplus
food or wastes of the other; shelter and transport may be involved.</p>

<p><b>Parasitism</b> is the state of symbiosis in which one of the members
feeds upon the other during the whole of either the immature or
mature feeding stage; the host is harmed in some way and may be
killed.</p>

<p><b>Predatism</b> is an association in which one member attacks and feeds
upon, or stores as food for its progeny, one or more other organisms;
the predator spends less than the immature or mature feeding period
on the prey. This category includes a few invertebrates and all the
vertebrates that capture, kill, and feed on cockroaches. This association
may be divided into interspecies predatism, in which the predator
preys upon a different species, and intraspecies predatism (cannibalism)
in which the predator preys upon its own species.</p>

<p>Although we have attempted to adhere to these definitions throughout
this discussion, we realize that in doing so we may have tended to
oversimplify complex relations. Some questionable interpretations
stem from insufficient knowledge of the basic relationships between
cockroaches and their associates. Only further study will clarify these
relationships. Some of the problems are discussed below.</p>

<p>Probably many of the so-called parasites (e.g., Protozoa like
<i>Nyctotherus</i>, and intestinal nematodes of the family Thelastomatidae),
which do not invade the host's tissues and seem to have no effect
on the activity and vitality of the host, are commensals. Although we
consider these forms to be commensals, we realize that they might
actually affect the host in some way even though this has not been
shown. It is possible that Rothschild and Clay's (1957) statement
about bird parasites may well apply to the apparently harmless organisms
found in the cockroach. These authors wrote, "It cannot be too
strongly emphasized that the effect of all types of parasites on the
host is detrimental. If we find that a bird seems little, if at all, inconvenienced
by the presence of Protozoa or worms or lice, or a
cuckoo in the nest, we can nevertheless assume that it would be better
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
off without them.... Small effects such as lack of vitality, loss of
voice, excessive blinking, or perverted habits like dirt eating are
extremely difficult to gauge. Nevertheless, it is only a question of
degree. Potentially all parasites are harmful." It should also be
pointed out that some workers would consider certain of our commensals
of cockroaches to be parasites. Thus Faust (1955) stated
that "A truly successful parasite is one which has developed a state
of equilibrium with its host, so that no detectable damage is produced
which endangers the health or life of the host. In a suitable host the
parasite may obtain food and shelter without any evidence of trauma
or toxicity. The damage produced may be so slight that repair and
functional readjustment keep pace with the injury." Faust's successful
parasite would be indistinguishable from a commensal, but
there is undeniably a difference between an organism causing slight,
and undetectable, damage to a host and one causing none. Certain of
the organisms we list as commensals may eventually be shown to be
parasites.</p>

<p>Certain organisms which live in cockroaches appear to have no
effect on the vitality of the host even though the tissues of the host are
invaded. Gregarines may penetrate the intestinal wall of the cockroach
without seeming to injure the host. Fungi of the genus <i>Herpomyces</i>
invade the cuticle of cockroaches producing pathological changes; yet
the insects' behavior is apparently unaffected (see p. 129). We consider
these organisms to be parasites because the host's tissues are invaded
and, as far as we know, no benefit to the host results.</p>

<p>In the literature certain insects have been considered to be either
parasites or predators or both. Among these are the ensign wasps
(Evaniidae), whose larvae feed on the eggs of cockroaches within
the o&ouml;theca, and the ampulicid wasps, which capture, paralyze, and
store in their nests (as food for their larvae) nymphs and adults of
cockroaches. Clausen (1940) claimed that the evaniid <i>Zeuxevania
splendidula</i> is a true egg parasite when it destroys the first egg in a
cockroach o&ouml;theca; but after the wasp larva molts and proceeds to
devour the other eggs, he considered it to be a predator. Clausen's
definition of an entomophagous parasite is an insect that in its larval
stage develops either internally or externally upon a <i>single</i> host which
is eventually killed; with few exceptions the adults are free-living
and their food is usually different from that of the larvae. A predatory
insect, by Clausen's definition, is principally free-living in the
larval as well as adult stage, kills the host immediately by direct attack,
and requires a number of victims to reach maturity; the predator is
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of greater size than the prey, and the food sources of the adults and
immature stages are frequently the same.</p>

<p>It is apparent, as Clausen and other writers have pointed out, that
there are instances of a particular species showing characteristics
which fit both the definitions for predator and parasite. Thus, among
the evaniids one wasp larva destroys all the eggs in an o&ouml;theca, but
in spite of this the larva has more of the characteristics of a parasite
than of a predator; the adult wasp does not utilize the same food as
the larva (adults have been taken on flowers and on honeydew from
scale insects). It is questionable whether the evaniid larva kills the
cockroach egg outright. The wasp larva, being restricted to the inside
of the o&ouml;theca, is not free-living. Probably the only criterion by which
the evaniid could be judged to be a predator, by Clausen's definition,
is that more than a single egg is devoured by the maturing wasp larva.</p>

<p>Among the other wasp parasites (Encyrtidae, Eulophidae, Eupelmidae)
of cockroach eggs many individuals develop in a single o&ouml;theca.
When a hundred or more wasps emerge from an o&ouml;theca which contained
less than 20 eggs, it is obvious that a single cockroach egg supported
more than one wasp, yet it is possible that one particular wasp
larva may have fed upon more than one cockroach egg before becoming
an adult. We consider all entomophagous wasps that develop
in cockroach o&ouml;thecae to be parasites rather than predators.</p>

<p>On the other hand, even though <i>Anastatus floridanus</i>, <i>A. tenuipes</i>,
and <i>Tetrastichus hagenowii</i> are egg parasites as larvae, the adult
females are, in a sense, predators when they sometimes eat part of the
cockroach egg that oozes through the oviposition puncture (Roth and
Willis, 1954a, 1954b). Williams (1929) has seen the female of
<i>Ampulex canaliculata</i> imbibe blood that oozed from the cut ends of
the cockroach's antennae after she had clipped them off before leading
the prey to her nest. Yet despite this evident predatism on the part
of the adult, the larva feeds as a parasite on the stored cockroaches
in accordance with Sweetman's (1936) (though not Clausen's 1940)
definition of parasitism, which is "that form of symbiosis in which one
symbiont lives in or on the host organism and feeds at its expense
during the whole of either the immature or mature feeding stage."
The ampulicid larva, as the evaniid, is not free-living and does not
kill the host immediately by direct attack, even though it may require
more than one victim to reach maturity. Thus, within one individual
both parasitic and predatory behavior are operant during different
stages of its life history.</p>

various biotic associations of cockroaches. Only a few examples are
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

<h3>BACTEROIDS</h3>

<p>Blochmann (1887, 1888) discovered intracellular particles (the
bacteroids or symbiotes of authors) that resembled bacteria in the
fat body of males and females of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Blattella
germanica</i> (pl. <a href="#plate_26">26</a>), in the ova of these insects, and in their embryos.
Bacteroids have since been found in at least 25 species and 19 genera
of cockroaches. Presumably such microorganisms are universally
distributed throughout the Blattaria. General reviews of the bacteroids
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of cockroaches and other insects have been published by Glaser
(1930b), Schwartz (1935), Steinhaus (1946, 1949), Buchner (1952,
1953), Brooks (1954), and Richards and Brooks (1958). The
reader is referred to these papers, and those of authors cited in the
list at the end of this section, for discussions of the morphology
of the bacteroids, their distribution within the host, and attempts to
culture them in vitro.</p>

<p>It has long been assumed, without proof, that cockroaches and their
bacteroids form a mutually beneficial association. As it has not been
possible to cultivate bacteroids apart from their cockroach hosts, it
may be assumed that the host is essential to the continued existence
of the microorganism, which also derives from the association other
obvious benefits as well. Experiments to show that the host also
benefits from the association have centered around rendering cockroaches
bacteroid free. Starvation, parasites, electromagnetic radiation,
heat or cold, or chemicals have all been used in attempts to
eliminate the bacteroids. Of these, only chemical treatment has provided
a satisfactory technique.</p>

<p>Few chemicals other than antibiotics have proved to be useful in
the elimination or reduction of bacteroids. Yetwin (1932) injected
various dilutions of 22 compounds into <i>Blattella germanica</i>. He observed
decreases in the bacteroids of the fat body only following
injection of methylene blue, but did not pursue this lead further.
Gier (<i>in</i> Steinhaus, 1946) observed reduction in the numbers of
bacteroids after cockroaches were injected with crystal violet, hexylresorcinol,
or metaphen. Bode (1936) reported that injection of
irritants such as lithium salts or quinine hydrochloride had no apparent
effect on the symbiotes.</p>

<p>Brooks (1957) reared <i>Blattella germanica</i> on diets containing different
concentrations of inorganic ions. On a manganese-deficient
diet the cockroaches grew poorly and some of their progeny lacked
normal bacteroids; about 10 percent of the aposymbiotic generation
grew and reproduced on a diet fortified with yeast. Varying the concentrations
of other salts in the diets gave results in which the
progeny were either aposymbiotic or the fat body was abnormal but
the mycetocytes were abundant; all these cockroaches soon died even
on fortified diets.</p>

<p>The administration of certain antibiotic drugs has produced cockroaches
very nearly free of bacteroids. Brues and Dunn (1945) found
that although sulfa drugs had no effect on the bacteroids, penicillin
in large doses reduced the number of bacteroids in <i>Blaberus craniifer</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
but the cockroaches died within a few days. Death was attributed to
lack of bacteroids rather than effect of the drug; this is perhaps an
unwarranted conclusion in view of the survival of aposymbiotic cockroaches
that have been produced by other drugs (Brooks, 1954;
Brooks and Richards, 1955). Glaser (1946) found that the bacteroids
of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> could be adversely affected or destroyed by
sulfathiazole, or sodium or calcium penicillin. Fraenkel (1952) questioned
the conclusions of Brues and Dunn (1945) and of Glaser
(1946) because of the high mortality in their experiments, and he
suggested that the described phenomena "were due rather to direct
toxic effects on the host than to loss of the symbionts." Noland (<i>in</i>
Brooks, 1954; Brooks and Richards, 1955) confirmed Glaser's results
with penicillin and extended sulfa treatments to include <i>Blattella
germanica</i>. Every female whose bacteroids were reduced to the
vanishing point resorbed her ovaries and was incapable of reproduction.
Brooks (1954; Brooks and Richards, 1955) found that administration
of several antibiotics did not eliminate the bacteroids from the
fat body of <i>B. germanica</i> unless the dose was so high that it caused
excessive mortality. Frank (1955, 1956) was able to eliminate bacteroids
from <i>Blatta orientalis</i> by injecting or feeding chlortetracycline,
oxytetracycline, or penicillin; survival of treated insects was not good
and reproduction was poor; the aposymbiotic individuals were smaller
than normal. As Richards and Brooks (1958) have pointed out, it is
uncertain how much of this difference was the result of loss of
bacteroids and how much the effect of the drug. It is obvious that in
all these experiments the action of the drugs on the bacteroids was
accompanied by equivocal side effects which confused interpretation
of the results. The effect on the cockroach of a loss of bacteroids
cannot be separated from a possible toxic effect of the drug.</p>

<p>Fortunately Brooks (1954; Brooks and Richards, 1955) obtained
completely aposymbiotic offspring from <i>Blattella germanica</i> that had
been reared on aureomycin. These bacteroid-free nymphs were practically
incapable of growth on a natural diet that was adequate for
nymphs with symbiotes. However, the addition of large amounts of
dried yeast to the diet enabled aposymbiotic nymphs to mature in two
to three times the period required by normal nymphs. Final proof
of the function of the bacteroids was obtained by reestablishing them
in aposymbiotic cockroaches. The insects that received implants of
normal fat body of <i>B. germanica</i> showed a slow, steady gain in weight
over the controls (Brooks, 1954; Brooks and Richards, 1956). Obviously,
the intracellular symbiotes subserve the normal nutrition of
the cockroach. Whether the bacteroids produce only vitaminlike substances,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
as suggested by Keller (1950), or function in some other way
is still to be determined. Brooks (1954) concluded that the amount
of vitamin-containing food required for increased growth by aposymbiotic
cockroaches is much greater than the known vitamin requirements;
hence the factor(s) needed is unknown and present in low
concentration, or it serves as a precursor of a second factor(s) whose
synthesis is aided by the bacteroids. Brooks (<i>in</i> Richards and Brooks,
1958) has since found that the bacteroids of <i>Blattella germanica</i> "can
supply the insect with B vitamins, amino acids and some larger protein
fragment."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Gier (1947) stated that the symbiotes of cockroaches are generically
all the same. However, as the symbiotes are presumed to have been
associated with cockroaches for over 300,000,000 years (Buchner,
1952) they may be assumed to have developed specific differences that
link them inseparably to their respective hosts. Ries (1932) transplanted
symbiote-containing fat body from <i>Blatta orientalis</i> into the
mealworm and larva of <i>Ephestia k&uuml;hniella</i>, and from <i>Blattella germanica</i>
and <i>Stegobium paniceum</i> (=<i>Sitodrepa panicea</i>) into <i>B.
orientalis</i>. The implants did not become established in the new host,
although most of the transplantations were successful in that the hosts
survived and the implants remained intact for some time before they
were encapsulated by host tissue. Brooks (1954; Brooks and Richards,
1956) transplanted fat body of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>B. orientalis</i>
into aposymbiotic <i>B. germanica</i>. The growth of the cockroaches injected
with foreign tissue was not different from that of aposymbiotic
controls. Sections of host insects did not contain mycetocytes and no
bacteroids were found. Haller (1955a) injected bacteroids or implanted
mycetocytes of <i>B. germanica</i> into gryllids, acridids, and
locustids. These implants and innoculations were rapidly destroyed
by the hosts. But as Richards and Brooks (1958) have pointed out,
none of these experiments provide information about the specificity
of the bacteroids themselves.</p>

<h3>BACTERIA</h3>

<p>Evidence showing that intestinal bacteria contribute to the nutrition
of cockroaches is meager. Cleveland et al. (1934) isolated a bacterial
organism from the foregut of the wood-feeding cockroach <i>Panesthia
angustipennis</i>. The bacterium digested cellulose rapidly in vitro and
these workers believe that this cockroach and other related wood-feeding
species are dependent on symbiotic bacteria for the digestion
of their food.</p>

<p>Mencl (1907) described cell nuclei in "symbiotic," not closely defined
types of bacilli that he found in abundance in the digestive tract
of the K&uuml;chenschabe, <i>Periplaneta</i> (presumably <i>Blatta orientalis</i>).
Unfortunately, he was more concerned about the morphology of the
bacteria than the stated mutualistic relationship, so nothing is known
of their physiology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">The growth rates of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Blattella germanica</i>
were retarded when the insects were reared aseptically, which suggests
that microorganisms normally found in the digestive tract supply
certain necessary dietary constituents (Gier, 1947a; House, 1949).
Noland et al. (1949) suggested that microorganisms in the digestive
tract of <i>B. germanica</i> synthesized riboflavin since the nymphs reared
on a low riboflavin diet accumulated more of the vitamin than could
have been ingested in the diet. However, Metcalf and Patton (1942)
found little or no bacterial synthesis of riboflavin in <i>P. americana</i>.
Noland and Baumann (1951) suggested that methionine, one of the
amino acids essential for rapid growth of <i>B. germanica</i>, was synthesized
by intestinal microorganisms in the insects.</p>


<h3>PROTOZOA</h3>

<p>It is probable that with few exceptions protozoa found in the
digestive tract are not necessary for survival of the cockroach. However,
very few experiments have been performed to determine the
importance, if any, of these microorganisms to the host. Cleveland
(1925) removed the protozoa from the cockroach (possibly <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>) by oxygenation at 3.5 atmospheres. The ciliates
<i>Nyctotherus</i> and <i>Balantidium</i>, flagellates <i>Lophomonas</i> and <i>Polymastix</i>,
the amoeba <i>Endamoeba blattae</i>, and three unidentified protozoa
were killed by this treatment, yet the insects lived normally
after defaunation.</p>

<p>Armer (1944) studied the effects of high-carbohydrate, high-fat,
and high-protein diets, as well as starvation, on the intestinal protozoa
(<i>Nyctotherus ovalis</i>, <i>Endamoeba blattae</i>, <i>Endolimax blattae</i>, <i>Lophomonas
striata</i>, and <i>Lophomonas blattarum</i>) in <i>Periplaneta americana</i>.
Starvation of the host lowered the incidence or eliminated most of
the protozoa, but a high-carbohydrate diet maintained them at a
relatively high level. <i>Lophomonas blattarum</i> was eliminated by a high-protein
diet, and practically eliminated by a high-fat diet. <i>Lophomonas
striata</i> was eliminated from some hosts that were kept on high-fat
and high-protein diets. <i>Endamoeba blattae</i> showed a decrease in
infection rate when the cockroaches were maintained on high-fat and
high-protein diets. The effects of diets on <i>Endolimax blattae</i> were not
uniform.</p>

<p>It has been shown by Cleveland (1930, 1948) and Cleveland et al.
(1931, 1934) that the wood-feeding cockroach <i>Cryptocercus punctulatus</i>
depends upon certain intestinal protozoa for survival; these
protozoa utilize as food the wood ingested by this cockroach. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
wood is broken down into compounds the cockroach can utilize by the
protozoa which elaborate a cellulase and possibly a cellobiase (Trager,
1932). Only molting nymphs of <i>Cryptocercus</i> can pass the protozoa
on to the newly hatched young, so that molting and hatching must
happen concurrently each year or the young die.</p>

<p>The sexual cycles in species of protozoa in the genera <i>Trichonympha</i>,
<i>Saccinobaculus</i>, <i>Oxymonas</i>, <i>Monocercomonoides</i>, <i>Hexamita</i>,
<i>Eucomonympha</i>, <i>Leptospironympha</i>, <i>Urinympha</i>, <i>Rhynchonympha</i>,
<i>Macrospironympha</i>, and <i>Barbulanympha</i> (fig. 3, B) are induced by
hormones produced by <i>Cryptocercus</i> only during its molting period
(Cleveland, 1931, 1947, 1947a, 1949-1956a). Perhaps the prothoracic
gland hormone of the host may be responsible for initiation of the
flagellate sexual cycles (Cleveland and Nutting, 1955). The protozoan
sexual cycles may be used as indicators of the onset of molting in
<i>Cryptocercus</i>; thus different species of protozoa begin their sexual
cycles from 35 days before to 2 days after molting of the cockroach
(Cleveland and Nutting, 1954). Hollande (1952) and Grass&eacute; (1952)
have reviewed the roles and the evolution of the flagellates in <i>Cryptocercus</i>
and in termites.</p>

<p>The protozoa of cockroaches and termites are clues to the relationship
between these two groups of insects. Kirby (1927) pointed out
similarities between <i>Endamoeba blattae</i> of <i>Periplaneta</i> and the
amoebae of the termite <i>Mirotermes</i>, suggesting that these protozoans
were probably derived from an amoeba in an ancestor common to
both blattid and termite. Kirby (1932, <i>in</i> Kidder, 1937) found a
species of <i>Nyctotherus</i> in <i>Amitermes</i> that resembles <i>Nyctotherus
ovalis</i> from domestic cockroaches. The belief that the termites and
cockroaches had a common origin is also strengthened by the similarities
between the hypermastigotes of both <i>Cryptocercus</i> and termites
(Cleveland et al., 1934).</p>

<p>The cockroaches <i>Cryptocercus</i> and <i>Panesthia</i> both feed on wood,
but the protozoa found in <i>Panesthia</i> resemble more closely the species
in domestic cockroaches than those in <i>Cryptocercus</i>. The Clevelandellidae
(from <i>Panesthia</i>) are closely related to <i>Nyctotherus</i> and have
probably evolved from common ancestors. However, the separation
of the Clevelandellidae from <i>Nyctotherus</i> must have taken place at a
later date than the divergence of their hosts, otherwise representatives
of that family would probably also be found in <i>Periplaneta</i> and <i>Blatta</i>
(Kidder, 1937).</p>

<p class="pmb3">The protozoa of <i>Cryptocercus</i> can be transferred from one individual
to another (Nutting and Cleveland, 1954). They can also be
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
transferred to the termite <i>Zootermopsis</i> where they survive only until
the host molts; the reverse is also true, <i>Zootermopsis</i> Protozoa can
survive in <i>Cryptocercus</i> until the cockroach molts (Nutting and
Cleveland, 1954a).</p>

<h4>* Coxsackie viruses</h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Experimental vectors.</i>&mdash;<i>Periplaneta americana</i>, U.S.A. (Fischer
and Syverton, 1951a, 1957): Recently Fischer and Syverton (1957)
found that after feeding a single meal of Coxsackie virus to <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>, the gastrointestinal tracts of the insects, which
were removed at 5-day intervals up to 20 days, contained sufficient
virus to paralyze and kill test mice. Cockroach salivary glands, removed
5 days after the insects had fed, contained the virus which
caused paralysis and death in test mice; mice were also infected by
virus obtained from salivary glands removed from the insects 10 and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
20 days after the cockroaches had fed once on the virus. The virus
was also isolated from the cockroaches' feces and rarely from the
fat bodies and reproductive organs. Fischer and Syverton concluded
that it is possible that cockroaches could acquire the virus, by feeding
on mammalian excreta, maintain it for a period of time, and transmit
it by contamination of food. The virus could also be transmitted
through the feces of wild mice if the mice happened to feed on virus-infected
cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Micrococcus pyogenes</i> var. <i>albus</i> (=<i>Staphylococcus albus</i>) and an
unidentified short rod form were found by Tauber (1940) in the
hemolymph of <i>B. orientalis</i>. These microorganisms were never found
together in the same insect and caused loss of appetite, sluggishness,
irregular respiratory movements, and paralysis in the cockroach; in
the final stages of the disease the legs were folded under the body,
the head was tucked beneath the forelegs, the whole insect became
arched and maintained this position until death. In some cockroaches
infected with the rod pathogen, conjunctival folds, particularly those
between the dorsal abdominal sclerites, and the joints of the metathoracic
legs ruptured liberating thick white hemolymph filled with
bacteria. Tauber suggested that the infection might be spread by
contact, especially to newly molted individuals or by actual ingestion
of the bacteria by the cockroaches feeding on dead or dying individuals.
All the roaches died after successful inoculation with the
<i>Micrococcus</i>. The bacterial infection was associated with high total
hemocyte counts and high percentages of mitotically dividing hemolymph
cells (Tauber, 1940); these responses of the insect were interpreted
as a mechanism whereby the number of hemocytes increases
resulting in an increase in the number of phagocytes for combating the
bacteria (Tauber and Griffiths, 1942).</p>

<p class="pmb2">By far the greatest number of fungi known to be associated with
cockroaches belong to the Laboulbeniaceae, genus <i>Herpomyces</i>, the
species of which are restricted to parasitizing cockroaches (Thaxter,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
1908). Most species are hyaline, small and inconspicuous (Thaxter,
1931) and are usually, but not exclusively, found on the insects'
antennae. Species of <i>Herpomyces</i> are highly, but not completely, host
specific (Richards and Smith, 1954). While attached to the host,
these fungi appear like minute dark-colored, yellow, or white (e.g.,
<i>H. arietinus</i>) bristles or bushy hairs (pl. <a href="#plate_27">27</a>, A).</p>

    <i>Herpomyces stylopygae</i> and the integument of <i>Blatta orientalis</i>. (Reproduced

  </span>
</div>

<p class="p2">Richards and Smith (1955, 1955a) have studied the life history of
<i>Herpomyces stylopygae</i> on the oriental cockroach. The plants grow
only on living cockroaches, and the infection is disseminated by contact.
The mature plants are found mostly on the antennae (pl. <a href="#plate_27">27</a>, B),
either on setae or on hard or soft cuticle. Spores are ejected from
perithecia singly or in groups of 2 to 4 spores, although groups as
large as 12 spores have been found. The presence of single, paired,
or multiple spore groups on the surface of the host was correlated
with the presence of single, paired, or multiple plants on infected
cockroaches. Development from spore to mature perithecia takes
about two weeks. The plant obtains nutriment from the host by
means of a tubular haustorium that extends through the cockroach's
cuticle and expands into a large bulb in the underlying epidermal
cells (fig. 1). Infections on nymphs are lost when the nymph moults,
but infections on adults persist throughout life. However, nymphs
which have lost the fungus upon moulting are readily reinfected.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Collart's (1947) statement that nymphs are never infected with
<i>Herpomyces</i> is not true.</p>

<p>Richards and Smith (1956) concluded that there is no evidence
of pathogenicity in <i>Herpomyces</i> infections because heavily infected
cockroaches appear fully active in laboratory colonies; they can run
at the same speed as uninfected cockroaches; they reproduce normally
and do not appear to die prematurely. These workers stated that the
infections cause a dermatitis which is neither pathogenic nor debilitant.
So far as we know there are no comparative data on longevity
and reproductive performance of fungus-infected versus normal
cockroaches. However, Gunn and Cosway (1938) have shown that
the presence of these fungi (identified as <i>Stigmatomyces</i> sp.; see
p. 138) on the antennae seemed to interfere with the humidity reactions
of <i>Blatta orientalis</i>. Although Richards and Smith (1956) admit
that humidity receptors and other sense organs on the antennae may be
destroyed by the fungus, they state that "insects possess such a large
number of sensilla that the result may well be more distressing to the
sensory physiologist than to the insect." Yet it seems to us that the
loss of sense organs from fungal infection and concomitant shortening
of the antennae (pl. <a href="#plate_27">27</a>, A) might be considerably more of a handicap
to free-living cockroaches than those in laboratory colonies.</p>

<p>Bode (1936) studied the flora of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and cultured
Aspergillaceae and Mucorinae from the insect's body surface
and intestinal contents; he also found nonsporulating yeasts in <i>P.
americana</i>. To prevent fungal growth on o&ouml;thecae of <i>P. americana</i>,
Griffiths and Tauber (1942a) autoclaved their rearing containers and
dipped the o&ouml;thecae in 70-percent alcohol for 10 seconds.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mercier (1906) isolated and cultured a pathogenic yeastlike parasite
which had invaded the fat body and blood of <i>Blatta orientalis</i>. The
abdomens of the infected insects became swollen, distended, and soft.
McShan (unpublished MS., 1953) consistently isolated Saccharomycetes
from the feces of <i>Periplaneta americana</i>.</p>

<p>The fungus was found growing on spines, tegmina, integument,
and antennae, at times abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;All the following data are from Richards and
Smith (1954):</p>

<p><i>Blatta orientalis</i>: A few plants matured.</p>

<p><i>Neostylopyga rhombifolia</i>: Some development but no mature
plants.</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta americana</i>: Fungus developed prolifically with a density

<p><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;"<i>Eurycotis floridana</i>," Mexico (Thaxter, 1905,
1908): On antennal setae.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Since this cockroach is not found in Mexico (J. A. G. Rehn, personal
communication, 1957), <i>E. floridana</i> is undoubtedly not the host
for this fungus. W. B. Brown (personal communication, 1957)
searched the cockroach collection at the Museum of Comparative
Zoology but was unable to find Thaxter's insect for reidentification.</p>


<h4>Herpomyces stylopygae&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Spegazzini</span></h4>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, Argentina (Spegazzini, 1917);

Smith, 1954): A few plants matured.</p>

<p><i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> (Richards and Smith, 1954): Some development
but no mature plants.</p>

<p class="pmb1">The fungus (fig. 1) is found on antennae (pl. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>, B, C), palpi,
cerci, and femurs. Thaxter (1931) believed <i>H. stylopygae</i> to be
synonymous with <i>H. periplanetae</i>. However, Richards and Smith
(1954) concluded that <i>H. stylopygae</i> would not grow on <i>P. americana</i>
under their laboratory conditions although <i>H. periplanetae</i> would grow
on <i>B. orientalis</i>. This indicated a strain or species difference between
the two fungi. Gunn and Cosway (1938) reported a species of <i>Stigmatomyces</i>
on the antennae of <i>B. orientalis</i>; this fungus was probably
<i>H. stylopygae</i> (Richards and Smith, 1956).</p>


<h4>Herpomyces supellae&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Thaxter)</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Supella supellectilium</i>, Trinidad (Thaxter, 1931):

<p><i>Leucophaea maderae</i>, Fernando Po (Spegazzini, 1915).</p>

<p><i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i>, Brazil (Thaxter, 1931).</p>

<p>Cockroaches, China? (Thaxter, 1902); Philippine Islands, Mindanao
(Thaxter, 1931).</p>

<p><i>Experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blaberus craniifer</i>, U.S.A. (Richards and
Smith, 1955).</p>

<p class="pmb1">Infections on the antennae. Richards and Smith (1954) were
unable to secure experimental infections in <i>L. maderae</i> with <i>H. tricuspidatus</i>.
Experiments with <i>N. cinerea</i> showed some development
but no mature plants although identification of the growing fungus
was uncertain because of simultaneous exposure to <i>H. ectobiae</i>, <i>H.
stylopygae</i>, and <i>H. tricuspidatus</i>.</p>


<h4>Herpomyces zanzibarinus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Thaxter</span></h4>

<p>The significance of many observed associations between cockroaches
and the higher plants is still obscure. Undoubtedly many associations
are ecological, but lack of adequate supporting evidence makes this
conclusion somewhat tentative. The ecological aspects are covered
in Section III (p. <a href="#Page_14">14</a>). Other associations may be accidental (e.g.,
certain unique observations that have never again been confirmed).
In the absence of contrary evidence, most associations are presumed
to be benign; exceptions to this conclusion are found among the cockroaches
that feed on living plants (p. <a href="#Page_162">162</a>) and those allegedly captured
as prey by the carnivorous pitcher plants (<i>Sarracenia</i> and
<i>Nepenthes</i>). In all the records cited below the cockroaches were
stated to have been on, in, or feeding on the plant.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The plants are listed below by family according to the taxonomic
arrangement of Lawrence (1951). Botanical nomenclature follows
Bailey (1925), Fernald (1950), or Dr. R. A. Howard (personal communications,
1958, 1959). We take full responsibility for referring
to appropriate taxa certain plants that were reported by common name

<h4>Bananas</h4>

<p>Cockroaches have been captured in bunches of bananas, in bracts
of banana flowers, under banana leaves, and burrowing in rotten
banana stalks. Although many of the species associated with bananas
are indigenous to the banana-growing areas of the American Tropics,
most of the specimens cited below were captured elsewhere as adventitious
insects that had been imported with the fruit. It is obvious
that many of these insects must have been closely associated with
bananas on the plantations, where, undoubtedly, the growing plants
provided attractive ecological niches. Bunting (1956) deduced, from
the presence of healthy cockroaches on bananas allegedly sprayed with
copper arsenate, that the insects did not feed on stems or fruit but hid
among the bananas and foraged elsewhere; however, certain reports
are of cockroaches actually feeding on bananas. Some of the records
cited by Hebard (1917) were compiled from earlier reports not all
of which we have seen. Numbers in parentheses following certain
citations indicate the number of times the association had been observed.
Known or suspected adventive material is so indicated.</p>

(personal communication, 1959) point out, this is a Central American
species, so Jamaica may be an error.</p>

<h3>DAMAGE TO PLANTS BY COCKROACHES</h3>

<p>Cockroaches characteristically feed on dead plant and animal material.
Damage to living plants occurs principally in the Tropics or
under subtropical conditions in greenhouses in temperate regions.
Among the depredations attributed to cockroaches in text books,
damage to plants is seldom emphasized. This is surprising in view of
the many records cited below.</p>

<p>Capt. William Bligh (1792), while collecting breadfruit trees in
Tahiti to take to the West Indies, wrote in his log during January
1789: "This morning, I ordered all the chests to be taken on shore,
and the inside of the ship to be washed with boiling water, to kill the
cockroaches. We were constantly obliged to be at great pains to keep
the ship clear of vermin, on account of the plants."</p>

<p>Westwood (1869) stated that <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> was very
destructive in orchid houses feeding on buds and young shoots. Later
Westwood (1876) exhibited the bulb of an orchid from Ecuador
which contained six species of cockroaches: <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, [<i>Periplaneta</i>?]
<i>americana</i>, [<i>Nauphoeta</i>?] <i>cinerea</i>, [<i>Leucophaea</i>?] <i>maderae</i>,
and two others unknown to him. Fullaway (1938) stated that cockroaches
damage root tips, buds, and flowers of orchids. <i>Periplaneta
americana</i> has been said to eat the root tips and blossoms of orchids
(Taschenberg, 1884) and to devour the open flower petals of <i>Cattleya</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
orchids as well as the aerial roots and flower spikes of <i>Vanda</i> orchids
(Rau, 1940a). Wainwright (1898) stated that <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>
had been observed in an orchid house in Perthshire where over
a period of three years it had caused a good deal of damage. Skinner
(1905) reported that <i>P. australasiae</i> in greenhouses in Pennsylvania
showed no preference for any one plant but ate both plants and flowers
of orchids, roses, and carnations. Lucas (1918) received specimens
of <i>P. australasiae</i> which had played havoc with orchids especially
<i>Cattleya</i> and <i>Vanda</i>. Morse (1920) reported that both <i>P. australasiae</i>
and <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> were obnoxious in a conservatory in
Massachusetts where they gnawed the tips of the aerial roots of orchids.
Swezey (1945) in Hawaii stated that the following cockroaches
have been reported as occasional minor pests on orchids:
<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Blaberus discoidalis</i>, <i>P. americana</i>, and <i>P. surinamensis</i>;
he further stated that <i>Graptoblatta notulata</i> had been intercepted
at Honolulu on orchids from India.</p>

<p>Watson (1907) stated that <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Periplaneta americana</i>,
and <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> were injurious in the tropical plant houses
at Kew: "at night they come out and run or fly about among the plants,
devouring flowers and leaves like rabbits. Such plants as <i>Eucharis</i>,
<i>Crinum</i> and <i>Alpinia</i>, when in flower, have little chance in the palm
house, where the cockroaches are most abundant; they also find out
the ripening bananas and soon devour them." Raffill (1910) stated
that in plant houses in England <i>B. orientalis</i>, <i>P. americana</i>, and <i>P.
australasiae</i> commonly, and <i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i>, <i>Nauphoeta flexivitta</i>,
and <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> more rarely, are extremely destructive
to plants. Flowers having a strong perfume, such as orchids, <i>Eucharis</i>,
<i>Crinum</i>, and <i>Hedychium</i>, were often attacked while other
flowers nearby were left uninjured.</p>

<p>Plank and Winters (1949) reported that in Puerto Rico the species
of Orthoptera most injurious under greenhouse conditions was <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>. Large nymphs destroyed 25 to 30 percent of
freshly planted seed of <i>Cinchona pubescens</i>. In Hawaii the host plants
of <i>P. americana</i> are blossoms of <i>Canna</i> and <i>Tribulus</i>, and the host
plants of <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> are <i>Pritchardia</i> and <i>Sida</i> (Zimmerman,
1948). On St. Kitts, B.W.I., young cotton plants were severely
attacked by <i>P. australasiae</i>; this caused loss of the stand on a considerable
area and necessitated replanting (Ballou, 1916). <i>P. australasiae</i>
was reported damaging the <i>Polystichum aristatum</i> Presl
[= <i>Lastrea aristata variegata</i>] in a greenhouse (Thilow and Riley,
1891). Laing (1946; British Museum [Natural History], 1951)
stated that <i>P. australasiae</i> abounds in greenhouses and forcing pits
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
where it may do considerable damage to the plants. <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i>
is also troublesome in greenhouses because of its tendency to
feed on seedlings and succulent plants (Dodge and Rickett, 1943).</p>

<p><i>Ectobius lapponicus</i> has been observed feeding in galleries in the
thick skin of young aspen in 25 percent of the trees examined (Stark
<i>in</i> Bei-Bienko, 1950). The aquatic cockroach <i>Epilampra abdomen nigrum</i>
fed on the leaves of <i>Jussiaea natans</i> in an aquarium (Crowell,
1946). <i>Ischnoptera deropeltiformis</i> has been taken while it was
feeding on a fleshy fungus (<i>Agaricus</i> sp.) in dense woods in Indiana
(Blatchley, 1920).</p>

<p><i>Diploptera punctata</i>, the cypress roach or beetle roach, has been
found in Hawaii feeding on ripening mangoes and papayas, oranges
on the tree, and the outer covering of the pods of <i>Acacia farnesiana</i>
(Bridwell and Swezey, 1915). Pemberton (1934) stated that <i>D.
punctata</i> "disfigures our cypress trees by eating the bark from the
young branches, often giving them a dead appearance over much of
their leaf area." Fullaway and Krauss (1945) added, "This injury
[to cypress] is so severe that sometimes areas of leaves die and turn
brown. The Japanese cedar, ironwood, citrus and algaroba (kiawe)
trees are attacked in a similar manner." Similar injury to cypress was
described by Hebard (1922). In addition to girdling <i>Cupressus</i>, <i>D.
punctata</i> injures <i>Cryptomeria</i> in the same fashion and also attacks
algaroba, lime, and other plants (Pemberton and Williams, 1938).
Zimmerman (1948) cited the following host plants for <i>D. punctata</i> in
Hawaii: "<i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i>, <i>Casuarina</i>, <i>Cryptomeria</i>, <i>Citrus</i>,
geraniums, <i>Acacia farnesiana</i> pods, mango fruits, orange fruits, papaya
fruits."</p>

<p>In the reports of damage to plants by cockroaches, <i>Pycnoscelus
surinamensis</i> has been implicated most often. This species is undoubtedly
one of the economically most important cockroaches, being
the vector of the chicken eyeworm as well as feeding on plants. In
addition to the few reports of damage caused by this species that have
already been mentioned, <i>P. surinamensis</i> has been reported to be very
destructive in New Orleans to palms and ferns, attacking large alsophilas
avidly, eating out the hearts (Anonymous, 1893). Zappe
(1918) in Connecticut reported damage in a greenhouse to roses
valued, at that time, at several hundred dollars; <i>P. surinamensis</i> had
girdled the rose bushes, done much damage to Easter lilies, and in
another greenhouse had eaten the bark from the stems of poinsettias.
In Germany this species bit off the tips of the aerial roots and ate the
petals of orchids (Zacher, 1920). Lucas (1923) reported damage to
cucumber plants in a greenhouse in Surrey. Damage by <i>P. surinamensis</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
to the stems of rose bushes has been reported in Rhode Island and
Pennsylvania; the canes were attacked both under and above ground
(Caudell, 1925). Doucette and Smith (1926) reported a heavy infestation
of <i>P. surinamensis</i> in a range of greenhouses in Philadelphia:
"The roaches were present literally by the millions.... Although the
roaches had been observed in cabinets and trash barrels for several
months, it was not until the manager had occasion to go through the
house one evening that he discovered that roaches were the cause of
the troubles previously attributed to soil condition, watering, fungus,
and other agencies.... About 30,000 to 35,000 rose plants from a
total of 200,000 in the three more heavily infested houses were so
badly injured by the gnawing off of the bark, young buds, and shoots
of the main stems, that they were not in condition to be kept in the
beds for another season."</p>

<p>In Haiti <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> damaged the tubers of growing
potatoes (Hoffman, 1927). Illingworth (1927, 1929) reported that in
Hawaii <i>P. surinamensis</i> was a minor pest of pineapples, feeding on
the roots. This species was very plentiful in a propagating pit in
England where it did much damage to various seeds and seedlings
(Lucas, 1930). Roeser (1940) summarized some of the above-mentioned
damage caused by <i>P. surinamensis</i> and added damage to chrysanthemums
in Hawaii and tobacco in Sumatra where this cockroach
destroyed 300,000 plants in a few days. Roeser was of the opinion
that living plants were eaten only as a substitute when the earth became
poor in food material. Zimmerman (1948) listed as host plants
of <i>P. surinamensis</i> in Hawaii: "blossoms of <i>Tribulus</i>; reported
feeding at roots of pineapples, and unconfirmed reports of damage to
underground parts of some other plants." Goodliffe (1958) reported
damage by this species to banana plants in a conservatory in northern
England. Cohic (1956) implied that in New Caledonia "Racines de
l&eacute;gumes" were attacked by <i>P. surinamensis</i> and that <i>Zea mays</i> Linnaeus
was attacked by <i>Supella supellectilium</i>. Wolcott (1924a) reported
that <i>P. surinamensis</i> damaged transplanted tobacco plants in
Puerto Rico by eating the interior of the stalks. Tobacco planters in
Cuba consider <i>P. surinamensis</i> injurious to the roots of tobacco plants
(Bruner and Scaramuzza, 1936); this belief was confirmed in the
laboratory, where adults and nymphs destroyed the roots and stems of
tobacco plants two inches high and ate into the edges of the leaves.
Dammerman (1929) reported that in Malaya this species often appeared
in large numbers in gardens where it gnawed at the underground
parts of vegetables and ornamental plants. Lever (1947)
listed it as a pest on the leaves of pineapple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3"><i>Blattella vaga</i> may occasionally damage seedlings in the laboratory
(Flock, 1941a), but no damage has been reported in the field (Ball
et al., 1942). Heer (1864) reported receiving a shipment of cycads
from Cuba with all stages of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> living in holes in
the branches, apparently subsisting on the starchy tissues. Goldenberg
(1877) stated that sago trees provide cockroaches with their
favorite nourishment. Scudder (1879) found <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>
living in the tops of the cabbage palmetto, on which he presumed it
fed. <i>Parcoblatta americana</i> has been observed feeding on an apple 6
feet above ground (Fulton, 1930).</p>

<p><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, France (Mercier, 1908a): The
organism parasitized the fat body of the cockroach. Mitoses, often
abnormal, were induced in the fat cells. Infected cockroaches were
easily recognizable by their distended abdomens. The fat body became
chalky white and showed through the intersegmental membranes.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Porter (1930) reported finding an unidentified microsporidian in

<p>Intestinal nematodes of the family Thelastomatidae have no apparent
pathological effect on their cockroach hosts. Galeb (1878) has
shown experimentally that oxyurids eat the same food as the host insect
and that if one starves them, by withholding food from the host,
the oxyurids die and disappear. In other words, these worms are not
parasites, in the sense that we use the term in this paper, but commensals.
Dobrovolny and Ackert (1934) stated that "all observations
seemed to indicate that the health, fertility and activity of the heavily
infested cockroaches were comparable with those of the non-parasitised
specimens."</p>

<p>Very few papers have dealt with the ecology of the oxyurid parasites
of cockroaches. According to Galeb (1878), usually one species
of nematode is found in a single cockroach, but sometimes two species
live together in the same host (e.g., in <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Polyphaga
aegyptiaca</i>) where they compete for food. Galeb claimed that <i>Hammerschmidtiella
diesingi</i> would replace <i>Leidynema appendiculata</i>; he
observed that <i>H. diesingi</i> surpassed <i>L. appendiculata</i> in numbers and
the latter became uncommon in the intestines of the cockroaches. On
the other hand, Sobolev (1937) found that 48 percent of his oriental
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
cockroaches were infected with both of the above species of nematodes.
The average number of both species was 7.5, and the maximum
number was 97; the mean number of <i>H. diesingi</i> was 5.1 and the
maximum 64; the mean number of <i>L. appendiculata</i> was 2.4 and the
maximum 33. More than 40 nematodes were found in each cockroach
of 1.3 percent of those examined. These results apparently contradict
Galeb's conclusions inasmuch as the number of each species in mixed
infections was essentially the same as the number found in cockroaches
infected by only one species (see pp. <a href="#Page_195">195</a> and <a href="#Page_197">197</a>). Dobrovolny
and Ackert (1934) found that 29 percent of 222 <i>Periplaneta
americana</i> contained both of the above species of nematodes; whereas
40 percent contained <i>L. appendiculata</i> only, and 21 percent contained
<i>H. diesingi</i> only. The infestation ranged from 1 to 36 worms per cockroach
with averages of 3.8 per male, 5.1 per female, and 2.7 per
nymph.</p>

<p>The eggs of some helminths pass unharmed through the guts of
cockroaches that serve as vectors of these ova and have no effect on
the insect. However, helminths that are secondary parasites in cockroaches
damage the insect to varying degrees depending upon the extent
of the infection. Thus the larvae of <i>Moniliformis moniliformis</i>
pass through the gut wall and some may become embedded in the fat
tissue (Moore, 1946). First stage larvae of <i>Oxyspirura mansoni</i> also
burrow through the midgut wall into the fat body; Sanders (1929)
believed that <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> could be killed if at one time
a sufficient number of migrating larvae of <i>O. mansoni</i> penetrated the
cockroach's intestinal wall. <i>Gongylonema neoplasticum</i> migrates
through the digestive tract and encysts in the muscles of the thorax
and legs of the host (Fibiger and Ditlevsen, 1914). Infective larvae
of <i>Protospirura muricola</i>, after hatching from ingested eggs, pass
through the cockroach's gut wall and encyst mainly in the thorax,
around the crop, and at the bases of the large muscles of the prothoracic
legs (Foster and Johnson, 1939). It is probably generally
true that nematodes which are secondary parasites in cockroaches do
some damage to the host's intestinal tract at least, and they probably
also damage other organs in which they may encyst.</p>

<p>Cockroach tissues may react defensively to infections by parasitic
nematodes. For example, encysted third-stage larvae of <i>Physaloptera
turgida</i> have been found enclosed in a thin, brown, chitinous substance
that was undoubtedly deposited by the tissue of the cockroach (Alicata,
1937). Cysts of similar appearance have been found in cockroaches
infected with <i>Physaloptera rara</i>, <i>P. maxillaris</i>, <i>P. hispida</i>
(Petri, 1950; Hobmaier, 1941; Schell, 1952), and <i>Gongylonema
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
pulchrum</i> (Schell, 1952a); in the latter species the deposit eventually
completely surrounded the nematode larva which was killed and
"chitinized." Apparently these pigmented cysts surround unhealthy
or dead larvae and are secreted as a defensive mechanism by the host
(Schell, 1952a). Oswald (1958) has reported finding similar pigmented
cysts in <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Periplaneta americana</i> that were
experimentally infected with <i>Rictularia coloradensis</i>.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Our classification of the helminths follows Hyman (1951, 1951a).</p>

<p>Cockroach, Venezuela (Tejera, 1926).</p>

<p>According to Hammerschmidt (1847) this worm may be found
throughout the intestinal canal but especially in the small intestine. It
is frequently found in adults and seldom in the nymphs. There were
seldom more than 5 to 10 worms in one cockroach and female worms
were found more frequently than males; the male worms were found
only in winter and spring while the females were present at all times
of the year. B&uuml;tschli (1871) stated that all stages from those just
hatching to mature males and females are found.</p>

<p>Yakimov and Miller (1922) found <i>H. diesingi</i> in 50.8 percent of
124 <i>B. orientalis</i> collected in Petrograd. Sobolev (1937) found 96
percent of <i>B. orientalis</i> infected with <i>H. diesingi</i> with a mean number
of 5.6 and maximum number of 22 in one cockroach. Groschaft
(1956) found 18 in one specimen of <i>B. orientalis</i>. Dobrovolny and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Ackert (1934) found about 50 percent of 222 <i>P. americana</i> infected
with <i>H. diesingi</i>. Sondak (1935) found about 36 percent of 412 <i>B.
orientalis</i> infected with either or both <i>H. diesingi</i> and <i>Leidynema appendiculata</i>.</p>

<p>Two molts occur during development of the eggs; the first takes
place outside the host resulting in a resting or infective stage.
After the egg in the infective stage is eaten by the host, the second
molt occurs before the egg hatches. Completion of the second molt
and hatching perhaps are connected with ammonia present in the digestive
tract; the ammonia seems to arise from the bacteria present
in the gut. There appears to be a relationship between the intestinal
bacteria of the cockroach and development and hatching of nematode
eggs (Todd, 1944).</p>

<p>At the time of oviposition the nematode eggs are in the very earliest
stages of cleavage. In 36 hours a motile, tadpole-like stage is reached
and in a few days the embryo becomes quiescent and nonmotile. This
nonmotile stage is infective whereas the motile embryonic stage is not.
Feeding experiments proved that transmission of the nematode is
direct. The worm reaches sexual maturity in 20 or 30 days after being
ingested by the cockroach (Dobrovolny, 1933).</p>

<p class="pmb1">The bacterium <i>Streptomyces leidynematis</i> Hoffman grows on the
cuticle of <i>H. diesingi</i> (Hoffman, 1953). The bacterium apparently is
only anchored to the nematode and probably obtains its food from the
intestinal contents of the cockroach. See notes under <i>Leidynema appendiculata</i>.</p>

<p>We have recently found (Roth and Willis, 1960) that two strains
of <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> exist; a parthenogenetic strain (from
Florida), and a bisexual strain (from Hawaii) which does not reproduce
parthenogenetically. The parthenogenetic strain is undoubtedly
the form that has been shown to be the host of <i>O. mansoni</i> in the
United States and Antigua, because only this form is found in the
New World. Probably the parthenogenetic strain was the form involved
in most Pacific areas. However, from internal evidence in his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
papers, we concluded that Schwabe, in Hawaii, may well have been
working with the bisexual strain and possibly also with the parthenogenetic
strain; if this is true, then both parthenogenetic and bisexual
strains of <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> may serve as intermediate hosts
of the eyeworm.</p>

normal development in all species of cockroaches except <i>B.
orientalis</i> and <i>P. americana</i> in which cysts developed that contained
a reddish-brown pigment; larvae in such cysts were dead or dying.
Eggs of <i>R. coloradensis</i> hatched in the midgut of <i>B. germanica</i> and
first-stage larvae entered the hindgut epithelium within 24 hours. The
larvae underwent two molts within a cyst formed by tissues of the
host's gut, the second molt occurring during the twelfth or thirteenth
day. In <i>Parcoblatta</i>, cysts were found free in the body cavity as well
as attached to the hindgut. In <i>B. germanica</i> and <i>S. supellectilium</i> the
cysts remained attached to the hindgut. Usually over 20 cysts developed
in each infected <i>Parcoblatta</i>; fewer than 10 per insect developed
in the other species. Larvae became infective to the definitive
host, the white-footed mouse [<i>Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis</i>

<p class="pmb3">Pocock (1893) noticed that a scorpion whose pectines had come in
contact with a cockroach immediately turned back and ate the insect.
He concluded that the scorpion detected the cockroach by means of the
pectines. However, Cloudsley-Thompson (1955) has demonstrated
that the main function of the pectines is probably the detection of
ground vibrations. He accounted for Pocock's observation by the
presence of sensory spines (presumably tactile) which project from
beneath the pectines. In a house in Arizona, Lyon (1951) observed
over 60 scorpions living in a kitchen cabinet that enclosed a sink. They
were apparently thriving on a heavy infestation of cockroaches.
Stahnke (1953) stated that he used <i>Periplaneta americana</i> as the principal
food for scorpions at the Poisonous Animals Research Laboratory
of Arizona State College. Cloudsley-Thompson (1955a) cited
cockroaches as one of the arthropods that scorpions feed upon.</p>

<p class="center font14 pmb1">Order ARANEIDA</p>


<p>Many observations of spiders feeding on cockroaches are quite
general, and many observers have failed to identify either the spider
or its prey. Belt (1874) stated that "the cockroaches that infest
houses in the tropics ... have numerous enemies&mdash;birds, rats,
scorpions, and spiders." When Belt tried to drive a cockroach toward
a large cockroach-eating spider, the insect rushed away from him until
it came within a foot of the spider when it would double back, never
advancing nearer.</p>

<p>Beebe (1925) watched a giant "wood roach," which was in the
grasp of a 2-inch ctenid spider, fly through the window of his British
Guiana laboratory. While the spider ate the cockroach, the insect gave
birth to 51 nymphs. Sonan (1924) reported that large gray spiders
devour nymphs and adults of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i>
in Formosa; this spider also occurs on Hiyakejima Island and
Okinawa. Passmore (1936), who has produced some excellent photographs
of tarantulas, stated that they destroy cockroaches. Rau
(1940) stated that American and oriental cockroaches were the
principal item of diet of a friend's pet tarantula for several years.
Kaston (personal communication, 1953) successfully fed a tarantula
with <i>Periplaneta americana</i>.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Bristowe (1941) found that the British species of <i>Ectobius</i> are
readily accepted by <i>Xysticus</i>, <i>Clubiona</i>, <i>Drassodes</i>, <i>Zelotes</i>, <i>Tarantula</i>,
and the web-builders <i>Ciniflo</i> and <i>Aranea</i>. The British domestic cockroaches
were accepted by <i>Tegenaria</i> and <i>Ciniflo</i>, spiders large enough
to overpower them, and were useful as food for tropical avicularids,
ctenids, and sparassids in captivity.</p>

<p class="pmb3">This (pl. <a href="#plate_30">30</a>, A) is a tropical species frequently imported into
northern localities with bunches of bananas (Comstock, 1912; Cloudsley-Thompson,
1953). Adults measure 3 to 4 inches across with
bodies over an inch long. They seldom leave their resting places
during the day, but are active at night and search for food. The female
does not spin a web (Bryan, 1915; Gertsch, 1949). The spider
turns the cockroach over onto its back at the instant of seizure and
holds it firmly against the substrate. The cockroach dies in 10 minutes
and is gradually rolled up by the spider as it sucks out the nutriment
(Moore <i>in</i> Williams et al., 1931). The spider does not attempt to
bite when captured, but if it does, its bite is said to be painful but not
dangerous (Cloudsley-Thompson, 1953). Zimmerman (1948) found
scores of <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> breeding in rock piles in Hawaii;
also present were large numbers of these spiders and centipedes which
presumably preyed upon the cockroaches.</p>

<h4>Latrodectus indistinctus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Pickard-Cambridge</span></h4>

<p><i>Common name.</i>&mdash;Button spider.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural prey.</i>&mdash;<i>Karnyia discoidalis</i>, South Africa, Western Cape
Province (Hesse, 1942): The nest is constructed on the ground
among grass stems or other vegetation. Preferred sites are slight
hollows, hoof imprints, etc. Nests are roughly tubular. The remains
of insects are entangled in the walls of the nest where they form dense
accumulations. Predatory activities of the spider are limited to an area
close to the tubular entrance to the nest and do not extend beyond the
trapping strands near the entrance. Capture is dependent upon accidental
contact of the insect with sticky threads surrounding the entrance.
This spider apparently attacks any insect or arachnid that becomes

cockroach, it is a known pest in stored foods (Baker and Wharton,
1952) and probably was brought into the culture with food. Rau
(1924) reported that the food of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> often became infested
with this species, but it did not affect the health or mortality of
the cockroaches in his culture.</p>

of a female cockroach that had been isolated for her entire adult life.
The mites were in a closely packed mass behind a plug of what appeared
to be feces, disintegrated eggs, and dried blood; none of the
mites were visible until this plug was removed. Baker (personal

by Dr. E. W. Baker (personal communication, 1954). The mites
cluster thickly on intersegmental membranes, particularly around the
coxae and neck. Despite a heavy infestation, the colony of <i>Nauphoeta</i>
thrived for several years. This mite was found first on <i>N. cinerea</i> and
possibly transferred to <i>D. punctata</i> when the latter was brought into

bases of the insects. Morphologically, the species is intermediate between
certain predaceous and phytophagous mites (Pritchard, 1956).</p>

<h4>Pimeliaphilus podapolipophagus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Tr&auml;g&aring;rdh</span></h4>

<p><i>Common name.</i>&mdash;Cockroach mite.</p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Parcoblatta</i> sp., U.S.A. (Edmunds, 1953a).</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta americana</i>, U.S.A. (Piquett and Fales, 1952).</p>

<p><i>Experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Blattella germanica</i>, and
<i>Periplaneta americana</i>, U.S.A. (Cunliffe, 1952).</p>

<p>Eggs of this mite (fig. 4) are usually laid indiscriminately in the
rearing cages, rarely on the host. Eggs are coated with a sticky secretion
which enables those laid on the host to adhere. Hatching occurs
in 6-11 days at 90-95&deg; F., and in 9-11 days at 80&deg; F. The newly
hatched larva starts to feed immediately on the cockroach. Larval
stage lasts 4-6 days, rests 2-3 days, and molts. During the single
nymphal instar, the mite feeds on the host and moves about for 6-7
days. The mite then rests 3-4 days before molting. Entire life cycle
covers a period of 28-32 days. Adult mite lives 2-3 weeks, during
which time it can produce 2-3 batches of from 1 to 20 eggs; the usual
batch is about 12 eggs. The mites are unable to live on cockroach
feces, cast skins, or dead cockroaches. Mites died within 4-5 days
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
unless live cockroaches were supplied. Parasitism was proved by detecting
radioactivity in mites that had fed on cockroaches which had
been previously fed radioactive NaCl (Cunliffe, 1952).</p>

<p>The mites can destroy laboratory cultures of cockroaches (Piquett
and Fales, 1952; Edmunds, 1953a). A cockroach attacked by 25
mites succumbed after about an hour, falling on its back; it died after
5 hours (Cunliffe, 1952).</p>

<p class="pmb2">When found in homes and offices, these mites are an indication of
the presence of cockroaches; the mite has been twice accused of biting
people (Baker et al., 1956).</p>


<h3>RECORDS OF UNIDENTIFIED MITES</h3>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Aglaopteryx facies</i>, Puerto Rico (Se&iacute;n, 1923):
Four red "tick" nymphs found under wings of female.</p>

<p><i>Blaberus craniifer</i>, U.S.A., Florida (Hebard, 1917): "A number of
lice [mites] are present on many of these specimens [28&#x2640;&#x2640;]."</p>

<p><i>Blaberus discoidalis</i>, adventive from West Indies, taken in Scotland
(Stewart, 1925): A considerable number of mites were all over the
body and hind wings.</p>

<p><i>Blatta orientalis</i>, Germany (Cornelius, 1853): Ex sexual organs
of male.</p>

<p><i>Blattella germanica</i>, U.S.A., in laboratory (Parker, 1939): Under
conditions of high humidity, the cockroaches became heavily infested
with mites. In cages where the infestation was heavy, an abnormally
large number of females dropped their o&ouml;thecae, and the percentage
of eggs hatching was low.</p>

<p><i>Parcoblatta uhleriana</i>, U.S.A., North Carolina (Hatcher, 1939):
Hypopi of mites were found deeply embedded in the fat body of two
individuals.</p>

<p>Mites in the hypopial stage attach to insects by which they are dispersed.
Hypopi have been found in the gill chambers of a mollusk
and in the gonads of a millipede (Baker and Wharton, 1952).</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta americana</i>, U.S.A., in laboratory (Fisk, 1951): The
insects were sluggish and molted with difficulty. Gold Coast Colony
(Macfie, 1922): Larvae of a tarsonemid mite were found in the feces.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>, Hawaii (Illingworth, 1915): During the
summer the soil was literally swarming with young of various stages.
Early in September most of the adults were dead and all were covered
with mites. U.S.A., Connecticut, in laboratory (Zappe, 1918a). Hawaii,
in laboratory (Schwabe, 1950): Some of the cockroaches apparently
died from mite infestations.</p>

<h3>CONTROL OF MITES IN COCKROACH COLONIES</h3>

<p class="pmb3">Fisk (1951) eliminated the mites [possibly <i>Pimeliaphilus podapolipophagus</i>
(Baker et al., 1956)] in his cockroach colony by using a 5-percent
spray and a 5-percent dust of p-chlorophenyl, p-chlorobenzene
sulfonate. The exterior of the cockroach containers were sprayed
with the solution and the interior, including the insects, were dusted.
Within a month the mites had disappeared and the vigor of the cockroach
colony improved. Piquett and Fales (1952) used flowers of
sulfur and general sanitary procedures for eliminating the mites in
laboratory colonies of <i>Blatta orientalis</i>; they cleaned the dishes every
few days and applied grease around the edges of the containers to
prevent new mite invasions. Qadri (1938) employed similar control
measures.</p>


<p class="center font16 pmb1">Class CHILOPODA</p>


<p class="pmb3">Large centipedes which entered houses in India probably sought out
cockroaches (Maxwell-Lefroy, 1909). In Puerto Rico, centipedes
entered homes to which they were attracted by cockroaches (Se&iacute;n,
1923). In Hawaii, centipedes preyed on insects generally but especially
on cockroaches (Bryan, 1915). Sonan (1924) reported that in
Formosa and Okinawa Islands a species of centipede 5 to 6 inches
long comes into the houses and devours both adults and nymphs of
<i>Periplaneta americana</i> or <i>P. australasiae</i>. Zimmerman (1948) found
<i>P. australasiae</i> breeding by scores in rock piles in Hawaii accompanied
by large numbers of <i>Scolopendra</i> and large spiders that probably
preyed upon the cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Experimental prey.</i>&mdash;Cockroaches, India, Nagpur (Jangi, 1955):
As soon as the centipede became aware of its prey, it rapidly embraced
the cockroach within its legs and with its fangs gripped the

fangs while its mouth parts prodded the victim's body. After feeding
on an adult cockroach, the centipede is not inclined to kill another for
2-3 days.</p>

either as parasites or as predators. Certain cockroaches have turned
the tables on their adversaries and become predators themselves. This

associates of other cockroaches, are discussed in chapters XV and
XVII.</p>

rhombifolia</i>, and <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, U.S.A. (Rilling, personal
communication, 1957): Mrs. Rilling wrote us that with the
exception of <i>N. rhombifolia</i>, all the above cockroaches were readily
eaten. All the mantids initially rejected <i>N. rhombifolia</i> after grasping
and making a brief attempt to chew the cockroaches. However, if
specimens of <i>N. rhombifolia</i> were left in the jars with the mantids, the
cockroaches were usually eaten within the next 24 hours. <i>N. rhombifolia</i>
ejects an odorous substance when seized and the mantids probably
ate these insects after most of this secretion had been depleted.
It is highly probable that the secretion of <i>N. rhombifolia</i> may deter
the mantid's attack, but it should be pointed out that, with the possible
exception of <i>N. cinerea</i>, all the other species fed to these mantids give
off odorous substances when seized or disturbed. Apparently, certain
naturally repellent compounds will deter this mantid, whereas others
that are presumed to be repellent will not; however, the nutritional
state of the mantid is undoubtedly a factor which may limit the effectiveness
of certain repellent secretions against this predator.</p>

(Riek, 1955).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Biology of Australian Ripidiini.</i>&mdash;The Australian species of Ripidiini
are parasites of apparently endemic, ground-dwelling species of
cockroaches. There is some correlation between host subfamily and
parasite genus: <i>Riekella</i> spp. [= <i>Nephrites</i>] have only been bred from
Blattinae. <i>Rhipidioides</i> spp. occur only in the closely related Ectobiinae
and Pseudomopinae. <i>Neonephrites</i> and <i>Neorhipidius</i> also occur
in the Pseudomopinae. <i>Paranephrites</i> occurs in the Panchlorinae.
There is some evidence that the parasitized cockroaches migrate onto
trees when the larval parasite is mature, as pupae have only been
found on the trunks of eucalyptus trees. In all species the larva leaves
the host dorsally through an intersegmental membrane. The host
continues to live for a few days after the parasite emerges. The larva
attaches itself to bark on the tree trunk by a few strands of silk before
pupating. The larviform, wingless female remains near the pupal skin
and is sought out by the winged male. The eggs are laid in a mass
around the pupal skin (Riek, 1955).</p>

<h4>Ripidius<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> boissyi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Abeille</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1">Balduf (1935) lists <i>Ripidius boissyi</i> as parasitic on nymphs of
<i>Ectobius pallidus</i> giving Abeille de Perrin (1909) as a source for this
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
information. However, Abeille de Perrin simply presumed that <i>R.
boissyi</i> parasitized <i>E. pallidus</i> because he collected this cockroach in
the same habitat as the beetle. Abeille de Perrin suggested that the
species of the genus <i>Ripidius</i> lived in the bodies of cockroaches, but
there are no rearing records, as far as we know, of <i>R. boissyi</i> from
cockroach hosts.</p>


<h4>Ripidius denisi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Chobaut</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1">Chobaut (1919), in France, collected both <i>R. denisi</i> and <i>Ectobius
pallidus</i> when beating an oak tree. Because of the known association
of other species of <i>Ripidius</i> with cockroaches, he presumed that this
beetle was parasitic on <i>E. pallidus</i>, a cockroach common in this beetle's
habitat.</p>


<h4>Ripidius pectinicornis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Thunberg</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Symbius blattarum</i> Sundevall [Leng, 1920].</p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blattella germanica</i>, on shipboard (Sundevall,
1831); Germany (Aclogue and Fowler, <i>in</i> Burr, 1899a); on steamship
"Samui" (Stamm, 1936); on cruiser "Duguay-Trouin" (Barbier,
1947); Hawaii (Williams, 1946a): This last record was based
on a specimen dissected from an adult German cockroach collected on
an airplane from the South Pacific. The parasite was reported as
<i>Ripidius</i> sp. by Williams, but Weber (1948) made the specific identification.</p>

<p><i>Ectobius pallidus</i>? Abeille de Perrin (1909) stated that <i>R. pectinicornis</i>
was first described by Sunders [sic] as <i>blattarum</i> because it had
been captured in the body of <i>Ectobia livida</i>. We presume that Abeille
de Perrin was referring to Sundevall's work in which the host was
given as <i>Blattella germanica</i>.</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta americana</i>, on shipboard (Sundevall, 1831): One
nymph only.</p>

<p>With the exception of the single nymph of <i>P. americana</i>, <i>R. pectinicornis</i>
apparently attacks only adult females and nymphs of <i>B. germanica</i>.
Barbier (1947) found only <i>B. germanica</i> parasitized, although
both <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Supella supellectilium</i> were prevalent
on board the ship. Primary larvae of the parasite failed to parasitize
<i>Supella</i>.</p>

<p><i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;The winged male is relatively active compared to
the apterous female; it runs around, flies well, and jumps on the female
when in her vicinity. The female remains stationary and lays
eggs around her by bending her long ovipositor (Sundevall, 1831).
The eggs (50-100) are laid among a network of silk fibers secreted by
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the female. The female dies after completing oviposition (Barbier,
1947).</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;The eggs hatch after 14 days, and the primary
(triungulin) larvae ascend the host's legs to its body; the larvae then
cut the intersegmental membrane between the metasternum and first
abdominal segment of the cockroach, in order to enter the host's abdomen
(Barbier, 1947). Chobaut (1892) first suggested this method
of attack by the ripiphorid larva. As the parasites develop, the abdomen
of the host becomes swollen. Developing larvae apparently eat
the host's fat body, leaving the vital organs until the last. Parasitized
female hosts were sterile and the eggs, when formed, never hatched.
Development of the o&ouml;theca was also inhibited. There were usually
two larval parasites per host, but three or four were found several
times (Barbier, 1947). Sundevall (1831) found only one larva per
cockroach except one host which, when crushed, yielded five. Stamm
(1936) found three hosts infested with five larvae each. In a little
over 100 cockroaches, Stamm found 10 that were parasitized.</p>

<p>The day before the parasite leaves the host, the cockroach shows an
abrupt uneasiness and runs about, finally falling over on its back. The
parasite larva emerges from the host through an opening it makes in
the membrane between penultimate and last tergite. The host dies a
few hours after the larva has left. The larva seeks a sheltered area
and pupates within 48 hours. Adults emerge in 9 days (females) and
13 days (males) (Barbier, 1947).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Adult males have been collected in light traps in
Hawaii (Van Zwaluenburg, 1946), and the first female was reported
by Weber (1948); the parasite is now established in the islands
around Pearl Harbor (Dr. F. X. Williams, personal communication,
1953). The U. S. National Museum has specimens of <i>R. pectinicornis</i>
from England, Guatemala, Hawaii, Panama, and from Florida and
Georgia in the U. S. (Dr. E. A. Chapin, personal communication,
1953). Kono (<i>in</i> Asano, 1937) reported two species in Japan. It is
noteworthy that all these records are from localities adjacent to oceans
and on ships; none are from interiors of continents. The only biological
data were obtained from parasites found on board ships. Sundevall
(1831) believed that the parasites boarded his ship with their hosts
during loading in Calcutta, since before that not any were seen on
board. Barbier (1947) suggested that the parasite must be spread
very easily in ports between neighboring ships by parasitized cockroaches
in baskets or sacks of provisions.</p>

<p class="center font14 pmb1">Order STREPSIPTERA</p>


<p class="pmb3">Pierce (1909) predicted that the Blattoidea and the Grylloidea
would be the only groups of the Orthoptera which would be parasitized
by Strepsiptera. Essig (1926) made the statement that certain cockroaches
are among the hosts of Strepsiptera. E. F. Riek (personal
communication, 1952) found a strepsipteron in a late nymph of
<i>Cutilia</i> sp. from Waroona, Western Australia; he wrote us, "The
female parasite is extruded between a pair of sternites towards the
base of the abdomen and appears to belong to the family Halictophagidae."
This is the only record that we have been able to find of a
strepsipteron parasitizing cockroaches.</p>

<h3>PREDATORS AND PARASITES OF COCKROACH EGGS</h3>

<p>Wasps from at least six families of Hymenoptera have been recorded
as developing on cockroach eggs. All the Evaniidae are presumed
to be parasitic in the egg capsules of cockroaches (Clausen,
1940; Townes, 1951), although hosts for many of the described
species have yet to be discovered. The presence of evaniids in dwellings
indicates the presence of cockroaches (Gross, 1950). At times
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
these wasps may become a nuisance; a family in Worthington, Ohio,
complained of the evaniid wasps that they found on the windows and
in other areas of their home, but they were apparently not annoyed
by the oriental cockroaches in the basement (Edmunds, 1953).</p>

<p>Adult wasps have been collected on <i>Asparagus officinalis</i> Linnaeus
(Schmiedeknecht <i>in</i> Schletterer, 1889; Crosskey, 1951). Thompson's
(1951) citation of records of <i>B. minutus</i> and <i>Evania appendigaster</i>
from <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Blattella germanica</i>, and Cameron's (1957)
citation of these records and one from <i>Ectobius lapponicus</i>, all attributed
to Kadocsa (1921), are almost certainly in error. Kadocsa
(1921, p. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>) listed these wasps as egg parasites of cockroaches but
not necessarily in Hungary and did not name specific cockroach hosts.</p>

<p>The present writers have found no information, other than host reports,
on the biology of <i>Brachygaster minutus</i>. The records of this
wasp parasitizing <i>B. germanica</i> may trace back to Schletterer, but his
listing may not have been an original observation. Since the female of
<i>B. germanica</i> carries its o&ouml;theca attached to the abdomen until or just
before the eggs hatch, it would seem that the female of <i>B. minutus</i> (if
the host records are valid) must oviposit into the o&ouml;theca of this
species while it is still being carried by the female; this would not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
necessarily be true for the other hosts which drop the egg case long
before the eggs hatch.</p>

<p><i>Leucophaea maderae</i> (Schletterer, 1889; Bordage, 1896; Kieffer,
1912): These records are probably erroneous inasmuch as this cockroach
incubates its eggs internally (Roth and Willis, 1954). Later,
after finding that <i>L. maderae</i> is ovoviviparous, Bordage (1913) admitted
having misidentified a parasitized o&ouml;theca from some other
species; he concluded that the developing eggs of this species are protected
against egg parasites because they are carried within the female.
Clausen (1940), in classifying the placement of parasitic wasp eggs
in relation to the host, erected the category: Egg placed in the embryo
while the latter is still within the parent. He stated that although this
behavior was not definitely known to occur, it probably could occur.
However, the records cited above do not indicate that the alleged
parasitization followed this pattern.</p>

above.]</p>

<p><i>Experimental host.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, U.S.A. (Haber, 1920).</p>

<p>Relatively little detailed information was known about this wasp
(fig. 5), one of the earliest parasites of cockroach eggs to be discovered,
until Cameron (1957) studied its biology. Arnold (Kirby
and Spence, 1826) discovered that the genus <i>Evania</i> parasitized
<i>Blatta</i>, but did not know whether the wasp developed on the cockroach
eggs or in the nymphs. MacLeay (Westwood, 1843) determined that
<i>Evania</i> developed within the o&ouml;thecae of cockroaches. Westwood
(1854a) found the larvae, pupae, and adults of <i>E. appendigaster</i> in
egg cases of an unidentified species of cockroach found on orchids received
from Calcutta.</p>

<p><i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;Adult wasps visited flowers of parsley, <i>Petroselium
crispum</i>, and fennel, <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> (Margretti <i>in</i> Schletterer,
1886; Crosskey, 1951). In Hawaii the adult wasps have been
seen resting on leaves coated with honey dew (Williams et al., 1931);
<i>Evania</i> sp. were attracted to the honey dew secreted by a diaspine scale
insect (Williams, 1931). Adults lived two to three weeks in captivity
with ample food and water (Cameron, 1957).</p>

<p class="pmb2"><i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;Shelford (1912, 1916) erroneously supposed that
<i>Evania</i>, by means of her cleaverlike abdomen, opened the o&ouml;theca at
the crista and then deposited her egg or eggs on the eggs of the cockroach.
Haber (1920) observed and described oviposition. The female
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
wasp crawled over the surface of the o&ouml;theca, actively vibrating her
antennae, and settled with the axis of her body parallel to the axis of
the egg case as it lay upon its right side. Lying on her right side, the
wasp extended her ovipositor and punctured the o&ouml;theca in the fifth
cell on the left side; she remained in this position for about 15
minutes. Cameron (1957) described similar oviposition behavior that
lasted about half an hour. Kieffer (1912) and Crosskey (1951)
stated that the female deposits her eggs before the walls of the o&ouml;theca
harden.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Development.</i>&mdash;Kieffer (1912) stated that the larvae in this family
eat the cockroach eggs and pupate in the o&ouml;theca without forming a
cocoon. Smith (1945) stated that the larva feeds on one cockroach
egg after another until all are destroyed; by that time it is full grown
and it pupates within the o&ouml;theca. Cameron (1957) found that there
are five larval instars and that in material from Saudi Arabia there
are three or possibly four generations a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Tropical and subtropical parts of the world as far
north as New York City, and all of Europe except the northern part
(Kieffer, 1920; Townes, 1949). The wide distribution of <i>Evania</i> has
been attributed to the abundance of host cockroaches on ships between
the Tropics (Haldeman, 1847). Kieffer (1903) appears to have
shown some correlation between the numbers of species of cockroaches
found in various geographical regions and the numbers of
species of evaniids found in similar regions. However, the number
of blattids he listed is small.</p>

<h4>Evania subspinosa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Kieffer</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Periplaneta</i> sp., Fiji (Lever, 1946): Although
Lever (1946) listed this species as a cockroach-egg parasite, he did not
state that he actually reared it from <i>Periplaneta</i> o&ouml;thecae.</p>


<h4>Hyptia dorsalis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">of Ashmead</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;Dr. H. Townes, (personal communication, 1956) believes
that this wasp was probably either <i>H. reticulata</i>, <i>H. harpyoides</i>,
or <i>H. thoracica</i>; it is not possible to tell which without reexamining
Ashmead's specimens; these apparently have been lost.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>, U.S.A., Mississippi (Ashmead,
1900).</p>


<h4>Hyptia harpyoides&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Bradley</span></h4>

1952a, 1953a, 1954).</p>

<p><i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>, U.S.A. (Muesebeck, 1958).</p>

<p><i>Parcoblatta uhleriana</i>, U.S.A., Natick, Mass.: O&ouml;theca collected by
L. Roth, May 17, 1956; wasp emerged June 12, 1956 (pl. <a href="#plate_33">33</a>, B); determined
by Dr. H. Townes. The keel region of the o&ouml;theca of <i>P.
uhleriana</i> (pl. <a href="#plate_18">18</a>, B) is different from that of any other species of
<i>Parcoblatta</i> (Hebard, 1917; Lawson, 1954) so there can be no doubt
as to the species of cockroach parasitized by this wasp.</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;The last instar larva overwinters inside the cockroach
o&ouml;theca (Edmunds, 1954). Five o&ouml;thecae yielded one parasite
each (Edmunds, 1953a).</p>

<p><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>, U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds,
1952a, 1953a, 1954).</p>

<p><i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;Copulation was rapid, lasting only a few seconds.
Blooms of <i>Asmorrhiza longistylis</i> were placed in a cage with adult
wasps. The insects were attracted to and fed on the flowers (Edmunds,
1954).</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;Entire contents of o&ouml;theca are eaten by the single
larva. Last instar larva overwinters inside the o&ouml;theca. Emergence in
Ohio was around the middle of June. The emergence hole made by
this genus was about 2 mm. in diameter. The hole was made at the
top side of the o&ouml;theca near one end. Adult took about 65 minutes
to emerge from the time its mandibles first broke through the o&ouml;thecal
wall. (Edmunds, 1954.)</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Canada, Ontario, U.S.A.: Connecticut to Wisconsin,

<p><i>Natural and experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, Istrian Peninsula
(Fahringer, 1922); Algeria (Cros, 1942); U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds,
1954).</p>

<p><i>Blattella germanica</i>? Europe? (Girault 1907, 1914); Europe (Fahringer,
1922). [The records on this host are extremely doubtful.
Girault erroneously cited Marlatt (1902) as the source of this record;
see footnote 6, page 236. Fahringer, however, claimed that he obtained
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
seven female parasites from o&ouml;thecae of <i>Blattella germanica</i>. He
placed female parasites with adults of <i>B. germanica</i> in a glass cage. As
soon as o&ouml;thecae could be seen between folds of a woolen rag, he removed
all the larger cockroaches and held the o&ouml;thecae until the parasites
emerged. Fahringer may have been dealing with a different
species of cockroach, because placing o&ouml;thecae in crevices (or between
folds of rag) is a habit foreign to <i>B. germanica</i>, the female of which
usually carries her o&ouml;theca until hatching or until about a day before.
Edmunds (1953b) could not induce this wasp to parasitize eggs of <i>B.
germanica</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta americana</i>, Istrian Peninsula (Fahringer, 1922); Palestine
(Bodenheimer, 1930); U.S.A., Ohio (Edmunds, 1952, 1953b, 1954).</p>

<p><i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;The wasps (pl. <a href="#plate_33">33</a>, A) are very active; they walk
about a great deal and fly short distances. They are often found in
abundance in buildings infested with the larger domiciliary cockroaches
where they may reproduce for many generations without leaving the
premises. Specimens have also been collected outdoors. (Edmunds,
1953, 1954.) As the adult walks about, the laterally compressed abdomen
moves up and down like a waving flag; because of this behavior,
these insects are commonly known as ensign-flies. Cros (1942) maintained
adults 17 days without food. Edmunds (1954) fed adults on
unidentified flowers in the laboratory. He also maintained them for 20
days after capture on a 5-percent honey solution.</p>

<p><i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;A female <i>P. punctata</i> selected o&ouml;thecae of <i>P. americana</i>
for oviposition and ignored those of <i>B. orientalis</i> and <i>Parcoblatta
pensylvanica</i> in the same cage. Oviposition was accomplished as described
for <i>Evania appendigaster</i>. One o&ouml;theca was turned over onto
its right side by the wasp before she oviposited. (Edmunds, 1952.)
Although there seemed to be a "preferred" position for oviposition, it
was not obligatory. The usual position was for the female to face the
keel of the o&ouml;theca, but she also oviposited from the opposite side or,
rarely, directly down into the side of the o&ouml;theca. The average time
spent by females in 10 ovipositions was 29 minutes (range 16-62
minutes). The wasp apparently could not determine whether the eggs
had been previously parasitized. The wasp laid her egg between the
cockroach eggs rather than in them and she oviposited into o&ouml;thecae
that had just been dropped and those two weeks old or older. On
three occasions nymphal cockroaches emerged within a few hours
after the wasp had oviposited. (Edmunds, 1954.) Apparently, for
successful parasitization the wasp must oviposit before the cockroaches
have reached the final stages of preemergence development.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Edmunds (1954) placed females of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> that were
carrying o&ouml;thecae, into cages with <i>Prosevania</i>; some of the female
wasps showed considerable interest in the attached o&ouml;thecae, but he
observed oviposition only into egg cases that had been dropped by the
cockroaches.</p>

<p>Cros (1942) described an interesting reaction that he called "instinctive
hostility" of the oriental cockroach toward <i>Prosevania</i>. A
wasp was placed in a jar in which a cockroach had just deposited its
o&ouml;theca. The wasp tried to oviposit into the egg case but was upset and
pursued by the cockroach. The cockroach placed herself over the
o&ouml;theca, standing high on her legs, and remained there motionless.
The wasp then approached from the rear, slipped under the cockroach,
and, unnoticed by the cockroach, climbed on the o&ouml;theca and oviposited
successfully.</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;In <i>Blatta orientalis</i>: The developmental period was
completed in 40-57 days in summer and fall (Cros, 1942). Time from
oviposition to emergence of adult varied from 45-177 days; three
parthenotes from an oviposition by an unfertilized female wasp developed
in 45-53 days (Edmunds, 1954). In <i>Blattella germanica</i>:
Almost 4 weeks spent in development (Fahringer, 1922). In <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>: Three wasps developed in 127 days (Edmunds,
1952). Only one parasite develops in each o&ouml;theca. There were three
generations a year in Ohio. (Edmunds, 1954.) In Algeria there were
two to three generations per year. The adult emerged from the
o&ouml;theca through a hole 4 mm. in diameter. (Cros, 1942.) Parthenogenesis
exists; the unfertilized eggs produced only males (Edmunds,
1954).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Eastern U.S.A., from New York and Ohio south to
Georgia (Townes, 1949). Europe, Syria, Palestine (Kieffer, 1920).</p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Loboptera decipiens</i>, France (Lavagne, 1914;

<p>Picard (1913) believed that <i>Z. splendidula</i> parasitized <i>L. decipiens</i>
and not its eggs; however, Lavagne (1914) explained the true relationship
by dissecting two specimens of <i>Z. splendidula</i> from o&ouml;thecae
of <i>L. decipiens</i>.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The following information is taken from Genieys (1924): <i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;Wasp
egg is introduced into the still-soft o&ouml;theca before the
wall hardens. Some o&ouml;thecae had four oviposition scars but never
contained more than two parasite eggs. <i>Development.</i>&mdash;Larva commences
development in July or August. Only one larva completes
development, but it eats all the eggs in the o&ouml;theca. The wasp passes
the winter as a last instar larva and pupates in the spring; the adult
emerges during the spring or in June. <i>Hyperparasitism.</i>&mdash;About 10
percent of the o&ouml;thecae of <i>Loboptera decipiens</i> that were parasitized
by <i>Z. splendidula</i> were also hyperparasitized by an eulophid (see

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blattella germanica</i>, Brazil, Distrito Federal
(Gomes, 1941): In the English summary of his paper, Gomes states
that <i>C. merceti</i> var. <i>falsicornis</i> was reared from <i>B. germanica</i>. However,
in the body of the paper, he states that the <i>supposed</i> origin of
the parasite was the o&ouml;theca of <i>B. germanica</i>. Burks (personal communication,
1956) does not believe that this wasp parasitizes the eggs
of <i>B. germanica</i>. We (unpublished data, 1957) exposed six o&ouml;thecae
of <i>B. germanica</i> to <i>C. merceti</i>. In order to retard water loss the
o&ouml;thecae were removed from the females by cutting the insects in two
so that each o&ouml;theca remained attached to the posterior part of the
abdomen. No wasps developed in these o&ouml;thecae.</p>

<p><i>Supella supellectilium</i>, U.S.A., Kansas (Lawson, 1954a); Hawaii
(Zimmerman, 1944; Compere, 1946; Keck, 1951).</p>

<p><i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;Males and nonovipositing females showed a flea-like
jumping tendency. Adults were attracted to light and were found
near windows. Both sexes pursued an erratic course in walking and
continually touched the surface with their antennae. (Lawson, 1954a.)</p>

<p><i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;The wasp (pl. <a href="#plate_34">34</a>, B) selected a site on an o&ouml;theca
with the sheath of her ovipositor; it was uncertain whether there was
a definite preference for oviposition sites. Wasp tended to choose a
nearly horizontal position for oviposition. She preferred to oviposit
into eggs about 2 weeks old, although she would place eggs in o&ouml;thecae
less than a week old and in embryos in the green band stage. There
were 1-50 oviposition punctures per o&ouml;theca. (Lawson, 1954a.)</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;If enough wasp larvae were present, they ate all
eggs in an o&ouml;theca. Occasionally wasps developed in one end of an
o&ouml;theca while cockroaches developed in the other; when this occurred,
the cockroach nymphs always emerged last. The developmental period
was 30-41 days at room temperature. There were 5-25 parasites
per o&ouml;theca. The single exit hole in the o&ouml;theca varied from 0.6 to 0.9
mm. in diameter. (Lawson, 1954a.)</p>

[= <i>Blattella</i>] <i>germanica</i>, <i>Phyllodromia</i> [= <i>Supella</i>] <i>supellectilium</i>
and/or <i>Phyllodromia treitliana</i>. We do not know to which

<h4>Anastatus blattidifurax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Girault</span></h4>

<p><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;Cockroach, Australia, Queensland (Girault, 1915).</p>


<h4>Anastatus floridanus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Roth and Willis</span></h4>

<p><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Eurycotis floridana</i>, U.S.A., Florida (Roth and
Willis, 1954a).</p>

<p><i>Experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>, and
<i>Periplaneta americana</i>, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis, 1954a).</p>

<p><i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;Female wasps are sexually receptive almost immediately
on leaving the o&ouml;theca. Mating takes 3-4 seconds. Males
mate repeatedly and may fertilize several females; females may also
mate more than once. At about 80&deg; F. the female wasps lived 2-4
days, males one day.</p>

<p><i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;The female wasp first probes the o&ouml;theca with her
sheathed ovipositor until she finds an acceptable spot; she then drills
through the wall of the o&ouml;theca with her ovipositor. One female oviposited
for 5 hours, but briefer periods were more usual. We have
seen six or more females ovipositing simultaneously into an o&ouml;theca
of <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>. One female was seen to feed on material that
oozed from the oviposition puncture. The wasp (pl. <a href="#plate_34">34</a>, A) may oviposit
into the o&ouml;theca of <i>E. floridana</i> while it is still being carried by
the female, as well as in o&ouml;thecae that have been dropped and which
have hard walls. Eggs 36 days old were successfully parasitized.</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;In <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>: In the laboratory, development
was completed in 34-36 days at about 85&deg; F. This time was
regulated to some extent by the number of parasites in the o&ouml;theca.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p>There is evidence that larvae eat unhatched wasp eggs or other larvae.
In 34 o&ouml;thecae exposed to many female wasps, the maximum number
of parasites to emerge was 306; yet an average of 601 wasp larvae
were dissected from four o&ouml;thecae that had each been exposed to 50
female wasps one week earlier. The larvae usually eat all the host
eggs. Cockroach eggs that were not eaten by the wasp larvae sometimes
developed but usually failed to hatch. Adult wasps made one
to six emergence holes in the o&ouml;theca; the average number in 42
o&ouml;thecae was two holes.</p>

<p><i>Number of parasites per o&ouml;theca.</i>&mdash;In <i>Blatta orientalis</i>: One of
111 o&ouml;thecae exposed to female wasps yielded 48 parasites. In <i>Eurycotis
floridana</i>: One o&ouml;theca parasitized in the field yielded 68 parasites;
8 o&ouml;thecae exposed to single wasps for their entire lifespan
yielded an average of 50 &plusmn; 6 parasites (range 23-81); 34 o&ouml;thecae
exposed to many wasps for their entire lifespan yielded an average of
198 &plusmn; 8 parasites (range 93-306). In <i>Periplaneta americana</i>: Nine
o&ouml;thecae of 152 exposed to the wasps were found to be parasitized
when dissected; 11 adults emerged from one o&ouml;theca; no parasites
emerged from the other 8 o&ouml;thecae.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Sex ratio.</i>&mdash;4 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642; from ovipositions by isolated females. In
the one o&ouml;theca collected in the field, the ratio was 21.6 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642;.
Parthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs produced only males.</p>


<h4>Anastatus tenuipes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Bol&iacute;var y Pieltain</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Anastatus blattidarum</i> Ferri&egrave;re. Dr. C. Ferri&egrave;re (personal
communication, 1957) is of the opinion that his <i>A. blattidarum</i>
is a synonym of <i>A. tenuipes</i>. He stated "I have never been able to see
the unique type of <i>A. tenuipes</i> B. y P., which is in Madrid, but the description
agrees with <i>A. blattidarum</i>. I had not yet knowledge of
Bol&iacute;var's description, when describing my species. The parasite of
cockroaches eggs [<i>Supella supellectilium</i>] should be called <i>A. tenuipes</i>
Bol." Mani (1938) synonymized <i>Solindenia blattiphagus</i> Mani with
<i>Anastatus blattidarum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Supella supellectilium</i>, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (Ferri&egrave;re,

<p>Cockroach, Hawaii (Weber, 1951); India (Mani, 1936).</p>

<p>The following is based on parasites that developed on eggs of
<i>Supella supellectilium</i> (Flock, 1941): <i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;Wasp may
be seen running rapidly on walls in buildings infested with the cockroach
host. The wasp rarely flies but hops proficiently; when disturbed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
it can hop from several inches to several feet. The female licks
up the drop of fluid that oozes from the oviposition puncture. Females
die in a few days, but if fed honey and water may live two
weeks. <i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;The female selects an o&ouml;theca by feeling with
her antennae. Flock stated, without citing experimental evidence, that
the age of the egg case was apparently the chief factor determining
choice. The wasp took 15-45 minutes to oviposit. Three females oviposited
simultaneously into a single o&ouml;theca; a single female repeatedly
oviposited into one o&ouml;theca at intervals. <i>Development.</i>&mdash;Completed
in an average of 32.6 days at a constant temperature of
82&deg; F.</p>

<p><i>Number of parasites per o&ouml;theca.</i>&mdash;Average about 10.7 (range 4-16)
(Flock, 1941); 15 (Ferri&egrave;re, 1935).</p>

<p><i>Sex ratio.</i>&mdash;4 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642; (Ferri&egrave;re, 1935); average of 6 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642;
(Flock, 1941). Parthenogenesis occurs; the unfertilized eggs produced
only males (Flock, 1941).</p>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Epomphaloides ischnopterae</i> Girault [Peck, 1951].</p>

<p>Parker and Thompson (1928) called their hyperparasite <i>Tetrastichus</i>
sp. However, Dr. B. D. Burks (personal communication, 1955)
has examined the teneral specimens which Parker and Thompson deposited
in the U.S. National Museum; he stated that the species is
apparently <i>Syntomosphyrum ischnopterae</i>. In view of the experimental
work by Parker and Thompson (see below), this wasp may
prove to be a hyperparasite on evaniids in cockroach o&ouml;thecae rather
than a primary parasite on cockroach eggs. (See <i>Zeuxevania splendidula</i>,
p. <a href="#Page_243">243</a>.)</p>

<p>The following information is from Parker and Thompson (1928):
<i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;Courtship and mating were accomplished as soon as
adults emerged, and in a manner similar to that in other chalcids. The
females oviposited only into o&ouml;thecae that were parasitized by
<i>Zeuxevania</i>, never into normal, nonparasitized o&ouml;thecae. <i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;Oviposition
occurred two days after mating. The female wasp stroked
the o&ouml;theca with her antennae, selected a site, and bored into the
o&ouml;theca with her ovipositor. She inserted the ovipositor deeply and
oviposited for 10-30 minutes. The eggs were deposited randomly on
the evaniid larva, some upright and others lying down. <i>Development.</i>&mdash;Eggs
of the hyperparasite hatched within 3 days and the larvae
commenced feeding on the host larva. There were 30 and 50 hyper-parasites
in two o&ouml;thecae. <i>Sex ratio.</i>&mdash;5 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642; (from 3 o&ouml;thecae).</p>

He stated, "The longitudinal dorsal grooves of the scutellum, which
are strongly developed in normal <i>hagenowii</i>, are only rather faintly
developed in Waterston's type and also the second specimen, which was
dissected and mounted on a series of ten microscope slides. No doubt
it was this faint development that caused Waterston to describe the
species in <i>Tetrastichodes</i>, a segregate that has since been recognized

<p><i>Experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>, and
<i>Periplaneta americana</i>, U.S.A. (Roth and Willis, 1954b): We have
maintained <i>T. hagenowii</i> for over two years through more than 30
generations on eggs of both <i>B. orientalis</i> and <i>P. americana</i>.</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i>, U.S.A., Pennsylvania (Roth and Willis,
1954b); Massachusetts (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1957).</p>

<p>Schmidt (1937) deduced that <i>T. hagenowii</i> was a primary parasite
of eggs of <i>P. americana</i> because the parasitized o&ouml;theca was obtained
from a cage covered with screen too fine to permit entry of a larger
parasite, such as an evaniid. As noted above, we have reared <i>T. hagenowii</i>
for more than 30 generations on cockroach eggs, none of which
was ever exposed to parasitization by an evaniid. If <i>T. hagenowii</i>
were ever hyperparasitic on <i>Evania</i>, this relationship would be accidental,
the eulophid happening to oviposit into an o&ouml;theca already containing
an evaniid, or vice versa.</p>

<p><i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;The male mates soon after becoming adult; he
mounts the female from behind, grasps her antennae with his own
antennae, and vibrates his wings during copulation. Mating is accomplished
in from "several" to 20 seconds (Takahashi, 1924; Edmunds,
1955). The adults are positively phototactic and are capable
of hopping for some distance (Edmunds, 1955). The females feed
on material that oozes through the oviposition puncture (Roth and
Willis, 1954b). Females lived 10 days (Se&iacute;n, 1923). Without food,
females lived 7.8 days and males 3.4 days, but when fed dilute honey
females lived 12.5 days (Usman, 1949). Females lived 5-11 days
(Roth and Willis, 1954b). Fed water and sugar, the wasps lived 2-6
weeks at 65&deg;F. (Cameron, 1955). Without food, 9 females lived an
average of 3.5 days and 9 males an average of 1.7 days, but when fed
on raisins, 9 females lived an average of 25 days and 9 males 15 days
(Edmunds, 1955). In Formosa there were six generations from April
to December (Maki, 1937).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>In Hawaii, Severin and Severin (1915) caught 571 <i>T. hagenowii</i> in
10 kerosene traps that were set up to sample populations of Mediterranean
fruitfly. Apparently the parasite is attracted by the odor of
kerosene.</p>

<p><i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;The female wasp explores the surface of the o&ouml;theca
with vibrating antennae (Edmunds, 1955). She bends her abdomen
ventrad and repeatedly touches the surface of the o&ouml;theca with her
valvae; when she finds an acceptable oviposition site, the wasp unsheathes
her ovipositor and bores through the wall of the o&ouml;theca
(Roth and Willis, 1954b). The wasp deposited her eggs in 2-5
minutes (Edmunds, 1955). Wasps oviposited (pl. <a href="#plate_34">34</a>, C) into young
or old eggs of <i>P. americana</i> (Roth and Willis, 1954b). A single wasp
parasitized more than one o&ouml;theca and more than one wasp oviposited
into the same o&ouml;theca (Roth and Willis, 1954b; Edmunds, 1955).
We found freshly laid wasp eggs in 34 empty but previously parasitized
o&ouml;thecae from which the wasps had emerged (Roth and Willis,
1954b).</p>

<p><i>Development.</i>&mdash;In <i>Periplaneta americana</i>: Development is completed
in an average of 36 days (range 29-58 days) (Maki, 1937);
29-40 days (Lever, 1943); average of 23.6 days (range 22-26 days) at
62&deg;-85&deg; F. (Usman, 1949); about 3 months at 60&deg;-65&deg; F. (Cameron,
1955); 31-60 days at 70&deg;-80&deg; F. (Edmunds, 1955). We found that
the wasps completed development in 23-56 days at about 85&deg; F., but
the period depended on the number of wasps in the o&ouml;theca; the
larger the number of wasps (up to an average of about 70 wasps per
o&ouml;theca), the shorter the time required to complete development.
Wasps in o&ouml;thecae containing 70 or more parasites developed in an
average of about 32 days (Roth and Willis, 1954b). Wasp larvae eat
the contents of the cockroach egg in which they start development,
then rupture the chorion and attack adjoining eggs (Cameron, 1955;
Edmunds, 1955). All eggs are consumed when the parasite density is
high, but if too few larvae develop per o&ouml;theca, some cockroach eggs
survive and the embryos complete development (Roth and Willis,
1954b). However, a certain number of cockroach nymphs must
complete development to enable the survivors to force open the crista
and emerge from the o&ouml;theca; fewer than this number of surviving
nymphs will be trapped and killed as effectively as if they had been
eaten by the parasite. The adult parasites emerge from one to three
holes cut through the wall of the o&ouml;theca (Usman, 1949; Roth and
Willis, 1954b).</p>

<p><i>Number of offspring per female.</i>&mdash;In <i>Blatta orientalis</i>: In the
laboratory, 5 o&ouml;thecae were left with each of 25 female wasps for their
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
entire lifespans; of the 125 o&ouml;thecae, 32 were parasitized. The
average number of offspring per female was 66 (range 5-164) (Roth
and Willis, 1954b). In <i>Periplaneta americana</i>: Each of 206 o&ouml;thecae
was exposed to a single female wasp for 24 hours; the average
number of offspring per female was 103 (range 50-139). Five
o&ouml;thecae were left with each of 38 females for their entire lifespans;
of the 190 o&ouml;thecae, 81 were parasitized. The average number of offspring
per female was 94 (range 45-168 [from original data]) (Roth
and Willis, 1954b).</p>

<p><i>Number of parasites per o&ouml;theca.</i>&mdash;In <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>: In the
laboratory, 3 o&ouml;thecae that had been exposed to 20 female wasps
yielded an average of 648 parasites (range 606 [from original data]
to 685) (Roth and Willis, 1954b). In <i>Neostylopyga rhombifolia</i>:
One o&ouml;theca yielded 73 parasites (Pemberton, 1941). In <i>Parcoblatta</i>
sp.: Two o&ouml;thecae yielded an average of 100 parasites (Edmunds,
1953a). In <i>Periplaneta americana</i>: 100 parasites per o&ouml;theca (Se&iacute;n,
1923); 140 (Schmidt, 1937); 25 (Rau, 1940a); 7-38, average 33
(Usman, 1949); 71 (Wolcott, 1951); 4 o&ouml;thecae exposed to 20 female
wasps yielded an average of 204 wasps (range 164 [from
original data] to 261) (Roth and Willis, 1954b); average of 30-40
(Cameron, 1955); 39 o&ouml;thecae yielded an average of 93 parasites
(range 12-187) (Edmunds, 1955). In <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>: O&ouml;thecae
yielded an average of 40-50 adult parasites (Cameron, 1955);
about 50 (Shaw, 1925).</p>

<p><i>Sex ratio.</i>&mdash;3 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642; (Usman, 1949); 4 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642; (Cameron,

1955). Parthenogenesis exists; the unfertilized eggs produced
only males (Roth and Willis, 1954b; Edmunds, 1955).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Probably worldwide. Eastern and southern U.S.A.;

<h4>Tetrastichus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">sp. I</span></h4>

<p><i>Taxonomy.</i>&mdash;Burks (personal communication, 1956) stated that this

very close to <i>T. hagenowii</i>.</p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Periplaneta americana</i>, Union of South Africa

City Health Department [Burks, p. c., 1956]).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>, Manila, Philippine Islands (Burks, p. c.,
1956).</p>


<h4>Tetrastichus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">sp. II</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;Because of the war, Cros (1942) could not determine
this insect specifically. He designated it provisionally and with reserve
under the name <i>Eulophus</i> sp. However, Burks (p. c., 1956) stated
that the species is most certainly a <i>Tetrastichus</i> from the description
given; but, it is apparently not <i>T. hagenowii</i> because of its brilliant
steel-blue color.</p>

<p class="pmb3"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, Algeria (Cros, 1942): <i>Adult behavior.</i>&mdash;Mating
began as soon as wasps emerged from an o&ouml;theca.
Males mated repeatedly. Adults lived up to 5 days in summer and up
to 12 days in fall. There were up to four generations per year in the
laboratory. <i>Oviposition.</i>&mdash;Wasps oviposited into o&ouml;thecae 6, 22, 40,
and 43 days old, and the parasites developed successfully. More than
one female oviposited into the same o&ouml;theca. Oviposition was of long
duration. <i>Development.</i>&mdash;From egg to eclosion took an average of 34
days in summer (range: 30-38 days, 5 o&ouml;thecae), and an average of
67 days in fall (range: 58-73 days, 3 o&ouml;thecae). An average of 55
parasites developed per o&ouml;theca (range 21-105, 5 o&ouml;thecae); over 130
wasps emerged from a sixth o&ouml;theca. <i>Sex ratio.</i>&mdash;10-20 &#x2640;&#x2640;:1 &#x2642;.</p>


<h3>HOST SELECTION BY EGG PARASITES</h3>

<p>The nature of the oviposition stimulus(i) for the wasp parasites of
cockroach eggs is unknown. Edmunds (1954) noted that <i>Prosevania
punctata</i> showed more interest in o&ouml;thecae that had been cemented to
the substrate than in clean o&ouml;thecae that had simply been dropped.
Cros (1942) experimented with two females of <i>P. punctata</i> to see if
the wasps could find o&ouml;thecae that had been buried in sand by the
oriental cockroach. After prospecting the sand with their antennae,
the wasps dug deep excavations with their front legs but always mistook
the location of the o&ouml;thecae. Cros suggested that the wasps were
misled by the odor left in the jar by the cockroaches. It is quite
possible that odor helps the wasp find the host o&ouml;theca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">The extent of host selection varies among these parasites; some
species will oviposit into the eggs of more than one species of cockroach,
but others show some degree of host specificity. Positive selection
of specific hosts by certain parasites appears in correlative data
from different investigators on pages 235 to 254. There is a small
body of data that shows nonacceptance of certain hosts by some of
these wasps. For example, <i>Comperia merceti</i> would not parasitize
eggs of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> or <i>Periplaneta americana</i> in the laboratory
(Lawson, 1954a). We (unpublished data, 1957) exposed a soft
o&ouml;theca, recently removed from <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>, to <i>C. merceti</i>; no
wasps developed; we had similar negative results with <i>C. merceti</i> and
o&ouml;thecae of <i>B. germanica</i>. We (1954b) could not induce <i>Tetrastichus
hagenowii</i> to parasitize eggs of <i>Blattella germanica</i>, <i>B. vaga</i>, or <i>Parcoblatta
virginica</i> in the laboratory. In our experiments, <i>T. hagenowii</i>
oviposited into eggs of <i>Supella supellectilium</i>, but the wasp eggs either
failed to hatch, or if they hatched, the larvae died before completing
development. Neither would <i>T. hagenowii</i> parasitize eggs of <i>N.
rhombifolia</i> (Roth and Willis, unpublished data, 1957). <i>Anastatus
tenuipes</i> would not parasitize the eggs of <i>Latiblattella lucifrons</i> Hebard,
<i>Periplaneta americana</i>, <i>B. germanica</i>, or <i>B. vaga</i> (Flock, 1941).
<i>Anastatus floridanus</i> would not oviposit into eggs of <i>S. supellectilium</i>
and only rarely into eggs of <i>P. americana</i> or <i>B. orientalis</i> (Roth and
Willis, 1954a); in the laboratory, this wasp could not be maintained
beyond one generation on the eggs of <i>P. americana</i>. Edmunds
(1953b) could not induce <i>Prosevania punctata</i> to parasitize eggs of <i>B.
germanica</i>. Cros (1942) induced <i>P. punctata</i> to oviposit into a mantid
o&ouml;theca, but neither mantids nor parasite developed.</p>


<h3>COCKROACH-HUNTING WASPS</h3>

<p>A number of wasps of the families Ampulicidae, Sphecidae, and a
very few species of Pompilidae have been found to provision their
nests with nymphal or adult cockroaches. This habit of preying on
cockroaches is primitive (Leclercq, 1954); Leclercq (personal communication,
1955) stated that this habit is always associated with the
conservation of a number of structures considered as archaic from a
purely morphological point of view.</p>

<p>The records of wasps of the genus <i>Astata</i> capturing cockroaches
(e.g., Sickmann, 1893; St. Fargeau <i>in</i> Sharp, 1899) "all trace back
to a questionable record by Lepeletier (1841) which probably was a
misidentification of the predator" (K. V. Krombein, personal communication,
1956). Marshall (1866) suggested that the braconid
<i>Paxylomma buccata</i> Br&eacute;b., which he found frequenting cockroach
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
runs in Pembrokeshire, was parasitic on <i>Ectobius nigripes</i> Stephens;
however, this wasp is undoubtedly parasitic on ants, probably on ant
larvae (Donisthorpe and Wilkinson, 1930).</p>

<p class="pmb3">The wasps that are known to capture cockroaches, and summaries
of their biology, are listed below.</p>


<h3>WASPS THAT PROVISION THEIR NESTS WITH COCKROACHES</h3>


<p class="p3 center font12 pmb1">Family POMPILIDAE</p>


<h4>Pompilus bracatus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Bingham</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;Cockroaches, India (Bingham, 1900).</p>


<h4>Pompilus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">sp.</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;Cockroach, Nyasaland (Lamborn <i>in</i> Poulton,
1926): The wasp was collected leading a nymph of the cockroach by
its antenna. The cockroach was in a stupefied state, and its antennae
were bitten off to about half their length.</p>


<h4>Salius verticalis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Smith</span></h4>

<p class="pmb3"><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;Cockroaches, India (Bingham, 1900).</p>


<p class="center font12 pmb1">Family AMPULICIDAE</p>

<p class="pmb1">The species of <i>Ampulex</i> do not appear to make special nests in
which to lay their eggs but drag their prey to any convenient hole, or
crack in the ground (Arnold, 1928). Although many species of <i>Ampulex</i>
have been described, the prey of only a small number of species
have been discovered, but the known prey are all cockroaches.</p>


<h4>Ampulex amoena&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">St&aring;l</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Ampulex novarae</i> Saussure [Krombein, personal communication,
1957].</p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>,
both as small nymphs, Formosa (Sonan, 1924, 1927): The wasp
stings a nymph about one inch long and carries it to a suitable place,
such as bamboo pipes, folds of newspaper, or books (in houses), for
oviposition.</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta picea</i>, Japan (Kamo, 1957; Kohriba, 1957).</p>

<p><i>Experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Periplaneta picea</i>, Japan (Kamo, 1957; Kohriba,
1957).</p>

<p class="pmb1">Kamo (1957) observed that in the field both males and females
sucked juices from wounds they made in the stems of <i>Clerodendron</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
<i>trichotomum</i> Thunberg or <i>Ilex rotunda</i> Thunberg. Kohriba (1957),
on the other hand, found both sexes sucking sap of <i>Abies</i> sp. and
other trees from points injured by the rostrum of cicadas. Kamo
(1957) observed that the female wasp grasped the cockroach by a
tergum and stung it several times in the thorax. The wasp always
amputated the antennae of the prey and sucked up the fluid oozing
from the cut antennae. The wasp egg was placed on the mesocoxa of
the cockroach. In the laboratory as many as three cockroaches, each
with a wasp egg, were stored in artificial nests per day. Kohriba
(1957) observed similar behavior in the laboratory and made these
additional notes. The paralyzed cockroach could move its legs and
was led to the nest by the wasp which seized its antennae. The egg
hatched in 2 days, and after sucking up body fluid for 2 days the
larva began to devour the prey. Three days later the larva spun its
cocoon, and about one month after spinning a female wasp emerged.</p>


<h4>Ampulex assimilis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Kohl</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blatta lateralis</i>, wingless females, Iraq (Hingston,
1925): Nesting sites are holes in palm trees, galleries of beetles, or
tunnels in ground. The wasp first seizes a cockroach by the edge of its
thorax and stings it in the thoracic region, then seizes the cockroach
by an antenna and pulls and leads it to the nest. The wasp deposits
her egg on the outer surface of the femur of the cockroach's midleg.
The nest is closed with debris; later the cockroach recovers from the
sting. The wasp larva first feeds externally, then bores into the cockroach
and devours the internal organs. Pupation occurs inside the
exoskeleton of the cockroach.</p>


<h4>Ampulex canaliculata&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Say)</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Rhinopsis caniculatus.</i></p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Ischnoptera</i> sp., U.S.A. (Krombein, 1951).</p>

<p><i>Lobopterella dimidiatipes</i>, Hawaii (Williams, 1928a, 1929).</p>

<p><i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>? MacNay (1954) referred to a rare
sphecoid wasp in eastern Canada which provisioned its nest with
nymphs and adults of <i>P. pensylvanica</i>. Dr. W. R. M. Mason (personal
communication, 1957) wrote us that although this wasp was
<i>Ampulex canaliculata</i>, it was not reared from the cockroach but was
swept from a pine tree. There are no positive records linking <i>A.
canaliculata</i> with <i>P. pensylvanica</i>.</p>

<p><i>Experimental host.</i>&mdash;<i>Parcoblatta virginica</i>, females, U.S.A., Missouri
(Williams, 1928a, 1929): figure 6.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb2">Nesting sites are in twigs (Krombein, 1951). The adult behavior
is similar to that of <i>A. compressa</i>; the female wasp imbibes blood
that oozes from the amputated antennae of the cockroach; the egg
hatches in 2-3 days, and the development of one male was completed
in 33 days (Williams, 1929).</p>

<i>Chlorion</i> (<i>Ampulex</i>) <i>compressum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

and <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>, Hawaii (Williams, 1942, 1942a).
Zimmerman's (1948) listings probably were taken from Williams.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Nesting sites.</i>&mdash;Holes in walls; holes in banyan and fig trees; in
houses in drawers and cartons. <i>Behavior.</i>&mdash;Similar to that of <i>A. assimilis</i>.
Bordage (1912) gives a complete description of capture of
prey. The female wasp cuts off part of the cockroach's antennae, legs,
and wings; she sticks her egg onto the host's mesothoracic coxa. The
wasp frequents houses in search of prey. Five &#x2640;&#x2640;, supplied with a
cockroach per day, stored an average of 57&plusmn;14 cockroaches; 8 &#x2640;&#x2640;
stored an average of 45&plusmn;3 cockroaches; these latter wasps were not
supplied with a cockroach per day throughout (mean values computed
from Williams, 1942). This wasp will not attack <i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i>
(Williams, 1942a) or <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> (Schwabe, 1950b).
On one occasion, <i>A. compressa</i> stung <i>Diploptera punctata</i>, but did not
oviposit (Williams, 1942a). <i>Development.</i>&mdash;Minimum 34 days, maximum
140 days (Williams, 1942). About 6 weeks (Swezey, 1944).
<i>Longevity of adults.</i>&mdash;13 &#x2640;&#x2640; lived an average of 110&plusmn;11 days (minimum
31, maximum 159); several &#x2642;&#x2642; lived 2 months (Williams,
1942).</p>


<h4>Ampulex fasciata&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Jurine</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Ectobius pallidus</i>, France (Picard, 1911, 1919):
Nesting sites are in brier or bramble stems, or in crevices in fig trees;
the female possibly uses old nests of leaf-cutter bees. The feeding of
the wasp larva is similar to that of other <i>Ampulex</i>. Adult wasp
emerges by cutting open a passage through its cocoon and through the
anus of the cockroach.</p>


<h4>Ampulex ruficornis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Cameron)</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;Cockroaches, Oriental region (Rothney <i>in</i> Sharp,
1899): Nesting sites are in crevices in bark. The female grasps the
cockroach by an antenna to drag it to her nest.</p>


<h4>Ampulex sibirica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Fabricius</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;Perkins referred to this species as <i>Ampulex sibirica</i>.
Williams (1942a), referring to Perkins's observations, mentions the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
species as "<i>A. compressiventris</i> Gu&eacute;rin (=<i>A. siberica</i> Sauss.)."
Krombein (personal communication, 1956) has commented upon this
synonymy as follows: <i>Ampulex siberica</i> Sauss. is apparently a misidentification
by Saussure of <i>sibirica</i> Fab. Kohl (1893) in his revision
of the genus <i>Ampulex</i> considered <i>A. compressiventris</i> Gu&eacute;rin to be
the correct name for this common African species and that <i>sibirica</i>,
described from Siberia, must be another species. However, Turner
(1912) stated that he had seen Fabricius's type specimen and that it
was identical with what had been called <i>compressiventris</i>; he considered
the Siberian locality given by Fabricius as an error. Krombein
suggested that Williams's use of the combination <i>siberica</i> Sauss. was a
lapsus and that the valid name, if Turner is correct, is <i>sibirica</i> Fab.</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;Cockroaches, West Africa (Perkins <i>in</i> Sharp,
1899): Nesting sites are keyholes. Enters apartments in search of
cockroaches. Wasp cocoon protrudes from dead body of cockroach.</p>


<h4>Ampulex sonnerati&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Kohl</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;"La mouche bleue" of Sonnerat (Kohl, 1893).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;"Kakkerlac," Philippine Islands (Sonnerat, 1776):
Nesting sites are readymade crevices. The wasp seizes the cockroach
by an antenna and stings the host many times in the "abdomen." She
drags the cockroach by an antenna to the nest, and, after depositing
her egg, plugs the opening with moistened earth.</p>


<h4>Dolichurus bicolor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Lepeletier</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;Schulz (1912) considered this to be <i>Dolichurus corniculus</i>.
Berland (1925) stated that this is possibly a color variety of <i>D.
corniculus</i>. Soyer (1947), from a study of the behavior of the wasps,
believed that both <i>D. bicolor</i> and <i>D. haemorrhous</i> are varieties of <i>D.
corniculus</i>. Krombein (personal communication, 1956) stated that <i>D.
corniculus</i> and <i>D. bicolor</i> differ in characters other than color alone
and that <i>D. bicolor</i> is considered a valid species today.</p>

<p><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;Cockroach, France (Benoist, 1927): The wasp was
observed closing the entrance to its burrow. Its egg was attached to
the coxa of the midleg of the cockroach.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Maneval (1932) stated that <i>D. bicolor</i> is found at the edge of dry
woods along with <i>D. corniculus</i> and that the wasp will also accept the
prey of <i>D. corniculus</i> if presented to it.</p>


<h4>Dolichurus corniculus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Spinola)</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Dolichurus haemorrhous</i> Costa [Schulz, 1912]. Berland
(1925) listed <i>D. haemorrhous</i> separately but stated that it is perhaps
a color variety of <i>D. corniculus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Blattella germanica</i>, France (Benoist, 1927).</p>

<p><i>Ectobius lapponicus</i>, Germany (Sickmann, 1893); Denmark
(Nielsen, 1903); Sweden (Adlerz, 1903); Italy (Grandi, 1931,
1954); France (Benoist, 1927; Maneval, 1928).</p>

<p><i>Ectobius pallidus</i>, France (Maneval, 1932; Soyer, 1947).</p>

<p><i>Ectobius panzeri</i>, France (Soyer, 1947).</p>

<p><i>Ectobius</i> sp., Italy (Grandi, 1954).</p>

<p><i>Hololampra punctata</i>, Pitten (Handlirsch, 1889).</p>

<p><i>Loboptera decipiens</i>, France (Ferton, 1894).</p>

<p>Cockroach, Netherlands (Bouwman, 1914).</p>

<p><i>Nesting sites.</i>&mdash;The wasp uses already-made cavities such as rotting
dead branches on ground, fissures in the earth, abandoned ant holes,
chinks in stone, or the empty cocoon of the ichneumon <i>Ophion luteus</i>
(Ferton, 1894; Maneval, 1932).</p>

<p><i>Behavior.</i>&mdash;The prey is immobile while being dragged to the nest
but recovers sufficiently from the sting so that if dug up it will run
around (Ferton, 1894; Bouwman, 1914; Benoist, 1927; Grandi,
1954). The wasp cuts off about two-thirds of the cockroach's antennae
prior to putting its prey in its nest (Adlerz, 1903; Bouwman, 1914;
Soyer, 1947). One cockroach is placed in the nest and the wasp's egg
is attached to the midcoxa (Ferton, 1894). Oviposition takes 5 to 6
minutes (Maneval, 1939). Wasp fills and seals its nest with bits of
earth and stones (Ferton, 1894; Grandi, 1954). The wasp larva feeds
externally and devours the entire cockroach, including its exoskeleton
(Ferton, 1894).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Development.</i>&mdash;Hatching occurs in 3 to 4 days (Ferton, 1894) or
longer during cooler weather (Maneval, 1939). Larval development
takes 6 days (Grandi, 1954), 8 days (Ferton, 1894), or 10 to 25 days
depending on season (Maneval, 1939).</p>


<h4>Dolichurus gilberti&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Turner</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural host.</i>&mdash;<i>Parcoblatta</i> sp., U.S.A., Virginia (Krombein, 1951,
1955): Nesting sites are under leaf litter. The prey was a paralyzed
third-instar nymph. <i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Ontario. U.S.A. from Canadian
border south to Florida in coastal States (Krombein, 1951).</p>


<h4>Dolichurus ignitus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Sm.</span></h4>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;Cockroaches, Natal and Southern Rhodesia (Arnold,

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
trunks of trees searching for small cockroaches in the crevices of the
bark."</p>


<h4>Dolichurus stantoni&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Ashmead)</span></h4>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;<i>Allacta similis</i>, nymphs, Hawaii (Williams et al.,

<p><i>Experimental hosts.</i>&mdash;"Field cockroaches," Philippine Islands
(Williams, 1944).</p>

<p class="pmb1"><i>Nesting site.</i>&mdash;Readymade crevices or holes in ground; porosity in
lava. <i>Behavior.</i>&mdash;The wasp seizes the cockroach by a cercus or leg
and stings it in the thorax. She (fig. 7, A) then drags the cockroach
to the nest by the base of an antenna. Wasp bites off distal part of
host's antennae. She deposits her egg on one of the host's midcoxae.
Nest is plugged with lumps of soil. The larva eats the entire host.
<i>Development.</i>&mdash;Eggs hatched in about a day and a half. Adults
emerged about 3 weeks later. About five generations per year. (Williams,
1918, 1919; Williams et al., 1931.)</p>


<h4>Dolichurus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">sp.</span></h4>

<p><i>Natural hosts.</i>&mdash;Cockroaches, nymphs, South Africa (Bridwell,

<p class="pmb1"><i>Nesting site.</i>&mdash;Plant stem, or in ground possibly an old abandoned
nest of <i>Ammophile</i>. <i>Behavior.</i>&mdash;Bridwell noted that one wasp larva
ate two cockroach nymphs before pupating; the adult emerged about
4 months after cocoon formation. Deleurance observed the wasp close
its nest with small pebbles, balls of earth, and small dead branches.
The wasp egg was placed on the femur of the midleg. The prey in the
nest is alert when disturbed. Deleurance believed the wasp was a
variety of <i>D. corniculus</i>.</p>

<h3>ANTS PREDACEOUS ON COCKROACHES</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A large roach endeavored to escape by crossing the main front of the
army. The creature made several powerful jumps, but each time it
touched the ground ... its legs were grasped by the fearless ants....
In the end it fell ... and was instantly torn to bits and carried to the
rear.... Another ant with the body of a wood roach was assisted by a
worker who held the carrier's abdomen high in the air out of the way
of her burden, all the way to the nest.</p>

<p class="center font12 pmb1">Family FORMICIDAE</p>

<p>From the known entomophagous habits of the lower ants (Wheeler,
1928), we wonder that there are not more records of ants feeding on
cockroaches, because this act must occur frequently. Kirby and
Spence (1822) stated that R. Kittoe had observed in Antigua that ants
which nested in the roofs would seize a cockroach by the legs so it
could not move, kill it, and carry it up to their nest. Hotchkiss (1874)
observed ants kill cockroaches on shipboard. Cockroaches attracted
to sugar in the pantry were killed and carried off by the ants. The
destruction of cockroaches by army ants has been recorded by Bates
(1863), Wallace (1891), Beebe (1917, 1919), Howes (1919), and
others. Dead and mutilated specimens of <i>Ischnoptera</i> sp. [undoubtedly
<i>Parcoblatta americana</i> (Gurney, personal communication,

(Mann, 1911).</p>

The cockroach is always wrong when arguing with a chicken.<br />
</p>
<p class="right">
<i>Spanish proverb</i> (<span class="smcap">Hartnack</span>, 1939)<br />
</p>

<p>Arboreal cockroaches hidden in and under bark are much more
likely to be encountered by birds than by other predators, and insectivorous
birds undoubtedly consume many more cockroaches than
the few records would indicate. Most of the records we have located
identify the birds at least by common name. Where possible we have
given the scientific names for those birds whose common names are
recognizably specific. We have followed the systematic classification
of Wetmore (1940).</p>

<p class="pmb3">Figuier (1869) stated that poultry and owls are very fond of cockroaches.
Perkins (1913) made the general statement that some of the
native birds of Hawaii are partial to the endemic <i>Allacta similis</i>.
Asano (1937) stated that in Japan natural enemies of cockroaches
may be found in the Galliformes, Strigiformes, Passeriformes, and
Piciformes. Although Lederer (1952) successfully fed newly molted
<i>Periplaneta americana</i> to insectivorous birds in the Zoological Garden,
Frankfurt am Main, <i>Blattella germanica</i> were preferred by these
birds. The following records are of specific birds feeding on cockroaches.</p>

<p>Only naturally occurring associations are included in this list. Commensal
cockroaches are listed on page 315. Bacteroids are not
listed because they undoubtedly occur in all species. The higher plants
were excluded because most of the associations may be too casual to
constitute symbiosis; however, many of the plant associations were included
in the chapter on ecology. The cockroaches and the associates
within each category are arranged alphabetically by genus and species.

<blockquote>
<p>These particular associations may well have been accidental and
due to a predilection for the same type of nesting site. But this fact
in no way detracts from the interest of such records. Chance must
play a very considerable part in first bringing symbiotic or commensal
partners together. Once such a partnership between species
has been firmly established, it is on the whole, fairly obvious, ...
On the other hand, in the early stages before the relationship has
become fixed as a specific habit, individual cases are generally
dismissed as coincidences. It is, however, unwise to disregard such
isolated observations or dismiss them lightly.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The following social insects have been found harboring cockroaches
in a state of commensalism in which the cockroaches presumably benefit
by acquiring food from their hosts. Benefits accruing to the hosts
are not apparent. Unfortunately, biological details are not always
sufficient to substantiate the suspected association. However, it seems
significant that the cockroach commensals of the insects listed below
have been found only in association with their hosts and, so far as we
know, have never been found apart from them. Chopard (1938) has
pointed out that the myrmecophilous cockroaches are all small, being
only a very few millimeters long; they are apterous or subapterous;
their eyes are reduced; and they are all of American origin.</p>

<p><i>Commensal.</i>&mdash;<i>Attaphila bergi</i>, Argentina and Uruguay (Bol&iacute;var,
1901): The cockroach was found in the nests of the ants sitting on
the back, neck, or head of sexual individuals. It remains attached to
the ant during swarming. The antennae seem always to be mutilated.
Bruch (1916) stated that in La Plata <i>A. bergi</i> is encountered by
hundreds in every nest of <i>A. lundi</i>.</p>


<h4>Acromyrmex niger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(F. Smith)</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Atta nigra</i> Schupp [Brown, p.c., 1957].</p>

<p><i>Attaphila aptera</i>, Esperanza, Dibulla, Colombia (Bol&iacute;var, 1905).</p>


<h4>Acromyrmex silvestrii&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">Emery</span></h4>

<p><i>Commensal.</i>&mdash;<i>Attaphila bergi</i>, or possibly a variety of this species,
San Luis Province, Argentina (Bruch, 1916): According to Bruch,
the behavior of this species of <i>Attaphila</i> is identical with the one encountered
in Huas&aacute;n in the nests of <i>Acromyrmex lobicornis</i> Emery;
it differed from <i>A. bergi</i> in size and color.</p>


<h4>Atta cephalotes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Linnaeus)</span></h4>

<p><i>Commensal.</i>&mdash;<i>Attaphila fungicola</i>, British Guiana (Wheeler,
1928): Taken in the fungus gardens of the ant.</p>

<p><i>Attaphila</i> sp., British Guiana (Beebe, 1921): 7 of 12 queens in one
nest had cockroaches hanging on them.</p>


<h4>Atta sexdens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Linnaeus)</span></h4>

<h4>Atta texana&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Buckley)</span></h4>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i>&mdash;<i>Atta fervens</i> Say [Wheeler, 1910].</p>

<p><i>Commensal.</i>&mdash;<i>Attaphila fungicola</i>, U.S.A., Texas (Wheeler, 1900,
1910): The cockroach does not feed on the fungus in the ants' nest,
as Wheeler (1900) first supposed, but mounts the back of the soldiers
and licks their surfaces. It is tolerated by the ants with no signs of
hostility. The antennae of the cockroach are clipped short. Although
Wheeler (1910) stated that this is probably accidental or unintentional,
it is peculiar that Bol&iacute;var (1905) noticed the same invariable
mutilation of the antennae of <i>Attaphila bergi</i>. Wheeler (1900) had
originally suggested that the antennae were probably clipped off by the
ants which are continuously trimming the fungus hyphae. Louisiana
(Moser, personal communication, 1959): Numerous specimens were
encountered in some nests of <i>A. texana</i>. This cockroach is the most
closely associated inquiline in the nest and maintains very intimate
terms with the ants. It is found living in the fungus cavities and
tunnels.</p>

<p><i>Commensal.</i>&mdash;<i>Myrmecoblatta wheeleri</i>, Guatemala (Hebard,
1917a): Collected from a colony of this ant under a stone on the
shores of Lake Atitlan, altitude 11,719 feet.</p>

<h4>Unknown host</h4>

<p class="pmb3"><i>Cockroach.</i>&mdash;<i>Attaphila flava</i>, British Honduras (Gurney, 1937):
Because the known hosts of the other five species of <i>Attaphila</i> are
ants, we presume that this species also lives in the nest of some myrmecine
ant.</p>


<p class="center font11 pmb1">Subfamily PONERINAE</p>


<h4>Odontomachus affinis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lsmall">(Gu&eacute;rin)</span></h4>

<h3>OBSCURE ASSOCIATIONS</h3>

<p>Cockroaches that are sometimes found in the nests of, or in association
with, other animals are not necessarily commensals. This is
particularly true of cockroaches that normally are found unassociated
with other animals or that merely occupy the same habitat with the
other animals because of similar microclimatic requirements (see
Chopard, 1924c).</p>

<p>McCook (1877) excavated in February a nest of <i>Formica rufa</i> in
Pennsylvania. A hundred or more lively cockroaches occupied a part
of the nest that contained few ants. Near the cockroaches McCook
also found a colony of <i>Termes flavipes</i>. <i>Ischnoptera deropeltiformis</i>
has been found in the company of ants, but it is probably not myrmecophilous
(Donisthorpe, 1900). Mann (1911) found an "<i>Ischnoptera</i>"
sp. (probably a species of <i>Parcoblatta</i>) abundant in the nests of,
and tolerated by, <i>Camponotus maccooki</i> Forel in California. Dead and
mutilated specimens of this cockroach were common in the nests of
"Formicas." "<i>Ischnoptera</i>" sp. was also common in the nests of <i>Veromessor
andrei</i> (Mayr) [= <i>Stenamma andrei</i>]. Hebard (1917) reported
that W. M. Wheeler collected <i>Eremoblatta subdiaphana</i> in
Arizona as an ant guest. Rehn (1906a; Rehn and Hebard, 1927) reported
that <i>Pholadoblatta inusitata</i> had also been taken by Wheeler
from the galleries of a jumping ant, <i>Odontomachus clarus</i> Roger
[= <i>O. haematodes insularis</i> Gu&eacute;rin var. <i>pallens</i> Wheeler; Brown
(personal communication, 1958)], on Andros Island, Bahamas; Rehn
and Hebard (1927) stated that "This genus and species is the only
blattid, which is presumably a myrmecophile, known from the West
Indies." Rehn (1932a) reported <i>Dendroblatta sobrina</i> as taken in an
ant nest in a tree in the Amazon Basin. <i>Tivia australica</i> was taken in
an ant nest in Australia (Princis, 1954). The male of <i>Compsodes
schwarzi</i> was taken in an ant nest in the Santa Rita Mountains of
Arizona (Ball et al., 1942). A male and female of <i>Stilpnoblatta
minuta</i> were taken in a migrating column of the ant <i>Myrmicaria natalensis</i>
Sm. subsp. <i>eumenoides</i> Gerst. in Nyasaland (Princis, 1949).
Princis cautioned that it is premature to derive any inference from
this, possibly accidental, association. Four females of <i>Parcoblatta
desertae</i> were taken about a nest of an ant, <i>Ischnomyrmex</i> sp. (Hebard,
1943a). A nymph of <i>Parcoblatta virginica</i> was found in a nest
of <i>Formica</i> sp. (Hauke, 1949).</p>

<p><i>Chorisoneura texensis</i> has been found in nests of webworm in
Florida (Rehn and Hebard, 1916). Karny (1924) in Malaya found
an o&ouml;theca of <i>Aristiger histrio</i> (sp.?) between leaves (<i>Costus</i> sp.)
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
that had been stuck together by a thysanopteron, <i>Anaphothrips</i> sp.
He pointed out that the o&ouml;theca would not adhere to leaves that were
not stuck together but would fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Se&iacute;n (<i>in</i> Rehn and Hebard, 1927) in Puerto Rico found <i>Aglaopteryx
facies</i> in abandoned cocoons of <i>Megalopyge krugii</i> (Dewitz)
and in leaves webbed together by caterpillars and in abandoned spiders
nests. Wolcott (1950; and <i>in</i> Rehn and Hebard, 1927) also found
<i>A. facies</i> in the empty cocoons of <i>M. krugii</i> and in the larval tents of
<i>Tetralopha scabridella</i> Ragonot on <i>Inga vera</i> (coffee shade tree); and
"Where there are no butterfly-nests, it lives in abandoned spider-nests
on the leaves of other forest trees." Cotton (<i>in</i> Wolcott, 1950) found
the type of <i>Aglaopteryx absimilis</i> also living in the abandoned cocoon
of <i>M. krugii</i> on bucare trees in Puerto Rico. Wolcott (1950) reported
that <i>Plectoptera dorsalis</i>, <i>Plectoptera infulata</i>, and <i>Plectoptera
rhabdota</i> have been found living in trees between leaves or in "butterfly-nests"
of <i>Tetralopha scabridella</i> in leaves of <i>Inga vera</i>, or nests of
<i>Pilocrocis secernalis</i> (M&ouml;schler) in the leaves of <i>Petitia domingensis</i>
in the mountains of Puerto Rico. Se&iacute;n (<i>in</i> Rehn and Hebard, 1927)
had collected <i>P. rhabdota</i> in the nest of larvae of <i>T. scabridella</i>.</p>

<p>Wolcott (1950) reported that <i>Nyctibora lutzi</i> had been found in a
large rotten stump associating with "'comej&eacute;n' termites [<i>Nasutitermes
costalis</i> (Holmgren)], yellow wood-ants and rhinoceros beetle grubs."
Rehn and Hebard (1927) found <i>Simblerastes jamaicanus</i> in numbers
in the debris of an abandoned termites' nest in Jamaica: "To what
extent the species is dependent upon the protection of the termite or
other structures remains to be determined."</p>

<p>In Virginia <i>Cryptocercus punctulatus</i> has been found living in the
same galleries with <i>Reticulitermes</i> sp., and on the Pacific Coast it has
been found occupying the same log with <i>Termopsis</i> sp. (Cleveland et
al., 1934).</p>

<p>Shelford (1909) found one male and one female of <i>Balta platysoma</i>
in a nest of a spider of the genus <i>Phryganoporus</i> and assumed a symbiotic
association. Chopard (1924) recorded <i>Mareta acutiventris</i> from
empty nests of spiders on Barkuda Island, India; nothing is known
of the relationships, if any, between these cockroaches and spiders.</p>

<p>Chopard (1924c) found <i>Margattea</i> sp. in the nest of the ant
<i>Acropyga acutiventris</i> Roger; he also found <i>Margattea</i> sp., <i>Periplaneta</i>
sp., <i>Polyphaga indica</i>, and <i>Temnopteryx obliquetruncata</i> in
deserted termite mounds in India. However, he believed that none of
these species were more than accidental associates of the host insects;
he considered them hygrophilous cockroaches which had found a retreat
in the nests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>McClure (1936) obtained a large nest of <i>Vespula maculata</i> (Linnaeus)
[= <i>Vespa maculata</i>] in March in Illinois. In it were living 65
nymphs of <i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>, 3 spiders (<i>Philodromus pernix</i>
Blackwall), 2 immature spiders (<i>Drassus</i> sp.), and 6 mites. Balduf
(1936) observed four individuals of <i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i> in a
nest of <i>Vespula maculata</i>; he suggested that they probably fed on
dead bodies and organic wastes of the wasps. However, Rau (1940)
has observed this cockroach devour a <i>Polistes</i> larva in its cell. Although
we do not imply that a commensal relationship exists between
<i>Parcoblatta</i> and the wasp, it is well to recall a statement by Rothschild
and Clay (1957): "A commensal relationship is potentially
even more dangerous than a merely social tie, for by nature it is more
intimate. The closer the association, the more easily is the balance upset.
One partner can then suddenly take a mean advantage of the
other."</p>

<p>Cockroach nymphs may enter bees' nests where, according to Imamura
(<i>in</i> Sonan, 1924), they do not feed on honey or pollen but presumably
feed on excreta of bees or anything scattered by bees in their
nest; the bees are not disturbed by the cockroaches.</p>

<p>Cockroaches that have been found in the burrows of vertebrates are
listed on pages 23-25.</p>

<p>Paulian (1950) found immature cockroaches in the nests of birds
(Ploceinae) in Madagascar and Ivory Coast. All nests of <i>Fondia</i> sp.
examined in Madagascar contained many cockroaches, and Paulian believed
that the blattid was a species peculiar to the nests of birds.
Three nests of <i>Ploceus</i> sp. in Ivory Coast yielded one or two cockroaches
each in association with more numerous mites, Psocoptera,
Heteroptera, beetles, and lepidopterous larvae (Delamare, Deboutteville
and Paulian, 1952). These last cited workers also found four
cockroaches in a nest of <i>Estrildine</i> sp., and two in a nest of an undetermined
bird, all in association with other arthropods. Moulton
(1912) observed large numbers of <i>Symploce cavernicola</i> and <i>Periplaneta
australasiae</i> swarming in soft bird guano on the floor of caves
in Borneo. Abdulali (1942) found in India many <i>Periplaneta americana</i>
in caves containing the edible-nest swift; there was no indication
of association of the cockroaches with the birds. Danforth (<i>in</i> Wolcott,
1950) reported finding large numbers of <i>Aglaopteryx facies</i>
"in the nests of the grey kingbird, in the region of the Cartagena
Lagoon [Puerto Rico], 'living among the twigs.'" In Trinidad, Kevan
found a male of <i>Blaberus discoidalis</i> in a bird's nest (Princis and
Kevan, 1955).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">Davis (<i>in</i> Rehn and Hebard, 1914a) stated that "At Punta Gorda
[Florida] there was a vacant house at the end of the town frequented
at night by a Nanny and Billy goat, and on warm evenings many <i>Periplaneta
australasiae</i> would run about on the piazza floor and on the
sides of the house. They were seen feeding on the excrement of the
goats and were no doubt to a great degree dependent upon them."
This is another example of a coprophagous insect that has taken
advantage of a particular situation favorable to its survival. Similar
associations exist in which many of the domiciliary cockroaches feed
on the feces of man and domestic and other animals (Roth and Willis,
1957a).</p>

<h3>INTERSPECIES PREDATION</h3>

<p>Tepper (1893) made the broad statement that the majority of
Australian and Polynesian cockroaches appear to be wholly carnivorous,
eating other insects, eggs, and larvae. He stated that, because of
their voracity and cannibalistic tendencies, the carnivorous species
lead more or less solitary lives so that one rarely meets several in
close proximity; they are never very numerous at any time because
the stronger devour the weaker in the absence of other prey. Tepper
stated that Australian species of <i>Ischnoptera</i> hunt for their prey
among the foliage of shrubs, and that Australian species of <i>Cutilia</i>
[= <i>Drymaplaneta</i>, Hebard (1943)] run about actively on the surface,
or ascend shrubs and trees in quest of living insects and therefore are
highly beneficial. Tepper (1894) also stated that <i>Geoscapheus robustus</i>
ate earthworms, grubs, and caterpillars. Froggatt (1906) and
Marlatt (1915) attributed to Tepper the statement that cockroaches,
like <i>Epilampra notabilis</i>, which are found out-of-doors in Australia,
are carnivorous and feed on caterpillars and other soft-bodied insects;
but Froggatt (1907) believed that this alleged behavior needed confirmation.</p>

<p>A number of observations have been recorded which indicate that
sometimes cockroaches may be predatory. According to Ealand
(1915), nymphs of the cockroach <i>Pseudomops cincta</i> fed on the Argentine
ant <i>Iridomyrmex humilis</i>. In the laboratory, <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>
has been observed to catch and devour the wasp <i>Anastatus
floridanus</i> which parasitizes the eggs of <i>Eurycotis</i> (Roth and Willis,
1954a). <i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i> was observed devouring a larva of
<i>Polistes</i> sp. in its cell in a deserted wasps' nest (Rau, 1940). Brigham
(1866) saw a cockroach kill and eat a centipede four or five inches
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
long. Annandale (1910) described the destruction in Calcutta of termites
by <i>Periplaneta americana</i>. During a heavy rain storm many termites
flew into the dining room and were set upon by the cockroaches
which seized them with their mandibles and began to gnaw their abdomens.
If disturbed, the cockroaches carried the termites away in
their mandibles without using their legs to seize, hold, or carry the
prey. Sometimes only the abdomen, but other times the whole body
with the exception of the wings, was devoured. Perhaps this observation
led Allyn (Anonymous, 1937) to theorize that, first, cockroaches
could eradicate termites from houses, and then the blattids in turn
could be eliminated. Falls (1938) has pointed out the unfeasibility of
this idea. <i>Blattella vaga</i> has shown some tendency to eat plant lice
(Flock, 1941a). Certain small cockroaches found beneath cane leaf-sheaths,
in the Philippine Islands, preyed in part upon leafhoppers
(Uichanco, <i>in</i> Williams et al., 1931).</p>

<p>Takahashi (1924) stated that the American cockroach will eat the
eggs of the hemipteron <i>Cantao ocellatus</i> (Thunberg). Cunliffe
(1952) observed mite-infested cockroaches (<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, <i>Blattella
germanica</i>, and/or <i>Periplaneta americana</i>) dislodge and eat the
mite <i>Pimeliaphilus podapolipophagus</i>. Sonan (1924) reported that
cockroaches (<i>P. americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i>) devoured the egg
clusters and first instar larvae of <i>Prodenia litula</i> and the first instar
larvae of <i>Attacus atlas</i> which were being reared in the laboratory.
Lederer (1952) stated that <i>Periplaneta americana</i> ate reptile eggs in
the aquarium at Frankfurt am Main. Pettit (1940) stated that cockroaches
"are said to have destroyed a large colony of dermestids used
to skeletonize carcasses at the University of Kansas."</p>

<p>DeFraula (1780) believed that his silent "gryllon" [obviously
<i>Blatta orientalis</i> from his drawings; see Willemet (1784)] was the
enemy of the chirping species of cricket, because after the cockroach
became established in his home he no longer heard crickets chirping.
Gilbert White (1905 ed.), writing in England in the late 18th century,
stated that "Poda says that these [<i>Blatta orientalis</i>] and house crickets
will not associate together; but he is mistaken in that assertion";
however, in August 1792 White noted that "Since the <i>blattae</i> have
been so much kept under, the crickets have greatly increased in
number." For several years Jolivet (1950) had observed changes in a
mixed population of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Acheta domesticus</i> in an old
kitchen in France. He suggested that the cyclical fluctuations in the
relative abundance of the cockroaches and crickets might be caused by
reciprocal predatism with one species more susceptible than the other
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
at certain stages. Mallis (1954) has stated that crickets prey on other
insects as well as on one another. Lh&eacute;ritier (1951) had also observed
crickets becoming rare in bakeries in France, having been superseded
everywhere by <i>B. orientalis</i>; however, he doubted that Jolivet's hypothesis
was the correct explanation and suggested that the higher
optimum temperature requirements of crickets might be the regulating
factor. Lederer (1952) stated that the number of crickets decreased
in the aquarium buildings at Frankfurt am Main as the population of
American cockroaches increased.</p>

<p><i>Platyzosteria novae seelandiae</i> was found under the bark of trees in
New Zealand devouring bugs (Walker <i>in</i> Shelford, 1909b).</p>

<p>For years it has been believed that cockroaches feed on bedbugs
(<i>Cimex lectularius</i> L.) and this statement has been repeated in many
reference works and articles. Ealand (1915) stated that cockroaches
devour bedbugs with avidity. Even today similar statements are to
be found in the literature. "In the old sailing ship days, they [cockroaches]
were often welcomed by crews because of the belief that they
would eradicate a population of bedbugs. This belief was based on
scientific fact, as cockroaches are known as predators of bedbugs"
(Monro, 1951). Cockroaches will often "help rid a house of bedbugs
by devouring all the little parasites they can capture" (Gaul, 1953).
The basis for this belief may have originated with a statement by
Webster (1834) who wrote that bedbugs disappeared aboard "H.M.
Sloop Chanticleer" when cockroaches made their appearance. Newman
(1855) reported the observations of a friend who claimed to
have seen a cockroach seize a bedbug in an infested boardinghouse in
London. In 1920 Purdy reintroduced cockroaches into a house from
which they had been exterminated, in order to control the bedbugs
which had become established. According to a popular account by
Lillingston (1934) African natives are said to ask sailors for a cockroach
or two to be used to hunt bedbugs.</p>

<p>In Siberia, Burr (1926, 1939) found <i>Blattella germanica</i> and bedbugs
inhabiting the same room. Mellanby (1939) studied the populations
of an animal house in which bedbugs and cockroaches occurred
in large numbers; the bugs apparently were not attacked and their
numbers increased greatly over a period of a few weeks (Johnson and
Mellanby, 1939). Wille (1920) placed starved <i>B. germanica</i> with
bedbugs for 20 days, but the cockroaches failed to attack the bugs.
In India, captive adults and nymphs of two species of house cockroaches
would not touch living bedbugs or their eggs (Cornwall,
1916). In laboratory experiments Gulati (1930) found that <i>Periplaneta americana</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
ate young bedbugs which had soft, blood-filled abdomens;
adult bedbugs with harder exoskeletons sometimes were
rejected. The maximum number of bedbugs eaten by a cockroach
was 3 out of 12 during a period of 48 hours. Johnson and Mellanby
(1939), also in laboratory experiments, were unable to show that bedbugs
can be controlled by <i>Blatta orientalis</i> or that bedbugs are eaten
to any extent by them. The existing evidence indicates that there is
little basis for the often repeated statement that cockroaches destroy
bedbugs in nature. As Lorando (1929) pointed out, assassin bugs,
cockroaches, and red ants can hardly be considered as practical factors
in bedbug control, though he did recommend the use of spiders.</p>

<p>According to Martini (1952), cockroaches prey on mosquitoes and
sand flies but we have been unable to find any original sources for
these statements; the only reference we have found in which cockroaches
and <i>Phlebotomus</i> are mentioned together is a paper by Whittingham
and Rook (1923); they fed ground-up cockroaches to larvae
of <i>Phlebotomus papatasii</i>. Wharton (1951) reported that cockroaches
and other predators attacked mosquitoes knocked down by insecticides
and affected the number recovered.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Cockroaches will on occasion attack and bite animals other than insects.
In an earlier paper (1957a) we discussed about 20 reports of
cockroaches biting man. The injury is usually confined to abrasion
of the callused portions of hands and feet but may result in small
wounds in the softer skin of the face and neck. We failed to include
the following reference in the above-mentioned paper. Sonan (1924)
had his toes and breast nibbled by cockroaches on Hiyakejima Island
during sleep. He had previously learned from a policeman that <i>Periplaneta
americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i> nibbled people on that island,
but he had hardly believed it before he experienced the biting himself.</p>


<h3>INTRASPECIES PREDATION</h3>

<p>Those who have reared cockroaches in the laboratory have undoubtedly
seen cannibalism occur in the cultures. Cannibalism has
been observed among the common domiciliary species of cockroaches
as well as laboratory colonies of <i>Leucophaea maderae</i> (Scharrer,
1953), and <i>Blaberus craniifer</i><a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (Saupe, 1928). Edmunds (1957)
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
reported that cannibalism was common in a laboratory colony of <i>Periplaneta
brunnea</i> and that egg capsules deposited by a female were
often eaten by the other cockroaches.</p>

<p><i>Periplaneta americana</i> occasionally ate other cockroaches and their
o&ouml;thecae and also attacked members of their own species (Lederer,
1952). Griffiths and Tauber (1942) recorded the killing of male
American cockroaches by females of the species: "One female was
especially vicious and attacked each new male as he was introduced
into the container. Most of such males had molted less than 2 days
previously. Older males were more capable of defending themselves
against attacks of these cannibalistic females." Even though adequate
food may be present, females of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> may eat their
own eggs (Klein, 1933). Some females may regularly eat their o&ouml;thecae
as soon as they are dropped (Griffiths and Tauber, 1942). To
be completely eaten an o&ouml;theca generally must be attacked before it
has hardened. If a hole is eaten in one side of the capsule, the cockroach
may devour the eggs and leave a portion of the o&ouml;theca. Frequently
only the keel or a part of the keel is eaten and when this occurs
the eggs fail to hatch and usually do not complete development because
of the rapid loss of water (Roth and Willis, 1955). When adults of
<i>P. americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i> were deprived of food, both males
and females ate newly deposited eggs and, finally, the females ate the
males (Sonan, 1924).</p>

<p><i>Parcoblatta virginica</i> in laboratory cultures also may eat part of its
o&ouml;thecae; in this species only the soft end of the recently deposited
o&ouml;theca was eaten (Roth, unpublished data, 1957).</p>

<p>Cros (1942) observed o&ouml;thecae-bearing females of <i>Blatta orientalis</i>
attack and kill males of the same species which were attempting to
mate; these males were then eaten by the females. Cros also observed
injured and recently molted nymphs of <i>B. orientalis</i> to be eaten by
others of the same species.</p>

<p>Pettit (1940) noted that cannibalism in his culture of <i>Blattella
germanica</i> occurred only when the insects were molting. Adult insects
attacked the molting cockroaches more often than did the nymphs.
However, nymphs after the fourth instar occasionally set upon other
molting nymphs. First-to third-instar nymphs rarely victimized their
mates. The victims were all older than third instar; the later stadia
were progressively more subject to attack, and molting adults suffered
the greatest mortality. No direct correlation was noted between population
density and cannibalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>German cockroaches may attack newly molted nymphs of their
own kind and cause them to deflate (Gould and Deay, 1938). Lh&eacute;ritier
(1951) has observed the hatching nymphs of <i>B. germanica</i> being
devoured by their congeners even before they have left the o&ouml;theca.</p>

<p><i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i> in laboratory cultures will eat newly hatched
young of the same species (Roth and Willis, 1954; Willis et al.,
1958). In Hawaii, in nature, <i>N. cinerea</i> may kill and eat the cypress
cockroach, <i>Diploptera punctata</i> (Illingworth, 1942; Fullaway and
Krauss, 1945).</p>

<p>Bunting (1956) stated that species of <i>Neoblattella</i> are omnivorous
with carnivorous and cannibalistic tendencies. An adult female
<i>Panchlora</i> sp. was killed and eaten by <i>Neoblattella</i> sp. in captivity. A
male, provisionally identified as <i>N. celeripes</i>, was killed and partly
eaten by two other males of the same species.</p>

<p>The factors influencing the extent of cannibalism among cockroaches
are not completely known. According to Wille (1920) hunger
was not the cause of cannibalism in <i>Blattella germanica</i>. Wille
claimed that the tendency toward cannibalism increased at high
temperatures and decreased at low temperatures. Pettit (1940) also
noted this effect. Gould and Deay (1938) stated that under crowded
laboratory conditions, when there was a scarcity of food, cannibalism
among <i>Periplaneta americana</i> was common. The injured cockroaches
and those unable to molt were often eaten. Adair (1923) made similar
observations. Undoubtedly, conditions of crowding, availability
of food, temperature and other factors all influence cannibalism, but
practically no experimental work has been done on this subject.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It is interesting, in comparison with the above positive examples
of cannibalism, that both Saupe (1928) and Roeser (1940) observed
no cannibalism during extensive studies with <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>.
In fact, Roeser stated that there was never a case of cannibalism
in spite of long hunger periods imposed on both nymphal and adult
insects.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="XVII_ASSOCIATIONS_AMONG_COCKROACHES">XVII. ASSOCIATIONS AMONG COCKROACHES</a></h2>


<p class="pmb3">Besides preying on their own species or on other blattids, cockroaches
exhibit additional symbiotic relationships among themselves.
These relationships are (1) the familial associations of parent and
offspring, (2) gregariousness, (3) intraspecies fighting, (4) interspecies
compatibility, and (5) interspecies antagonism. There are
some inconsistencies between observations made on the same species
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
by different workers, which only further observation and experimentation
will explain. Some of the reported observations are unique; this
is especially true for the feral species. Because of the paucity of information,
it is impossible at this time to make valid generalizations
about some of these interesting relationships.</p>


<h3>FAMILIAL ASSOCIATIONS</h3>

<p>The females of many species of cockroaches insure varying degrees
of protection to the developing young in their ways of disposing of the
o&ouml;theca after it has been formed. The extent of this association between
the mother and her developing progeny varies from the minimum
amount of time spent by oviparous females in concealing their
o&ouml;thecae, to the duration of embryogenesis in the so-called viviparous
species, a period of over a month or more.</p>

<p>Haber (1920a) observed a female of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> chew a
groove in a piece of pasteboard into which she attempted to deposit
her o&ouml;theca. The o&ouml;theca failed to adhere to the shallow hole and fell
to the floor. After several futile attempts to replace the o&ouml;theca in the
hole, the female finally left the egg case on the floor of the cage and
coated it with an oral secretion to which she attached bits of trash.
During this operation she chased other females away when they
ventured near the site. Qadri (1938) described the behavior of the
female of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> in concealing her o&ouml;theca in a hole that she
dug in sand; she deposited the egg case in the hole, coated it with
saliva and sand, and then refilled the pit. Rau (1943) described in
detail how females of <i>P. americana</i> and <i>B. orientalis</i> covered their
o&ouml;thecae with wood dust or sand in holes they had prepared in the
substrate. Both species placed a sticky oral secretion in the holes and
then deposited their o&ouml;thecae therein. After coating the o&ouml;thecae with
more sticky secretion, the females adjusted the o&ouml;thecae so that the
keels were uppermost and then carefully concealed the o&ouml;thecae with
the excavated debris. Both females spent over an hour in the act.
Rau (1924) previously reported that of 90 o&ouml;thecae deposited by <i>B.
orientalis</i> in jars containing earth and trash, 36 were placed in crevices
or excavated holes, and 38 were hidden by being covered with dirt
stuck to them with saliva; only 16 were left uncovered.</p>

<p>Edmunds (1957) described oviposition by <i>Periplaneta brunnea</i>.
Some females spent from 30 to 40 minutes secreting from the mouth
a frothy substance that was smeared on the substrate; the egg capsule
was deposited in the secretion and covered with additional froth,
which hardened into a very strong cement. Some females spent as
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
long as two hours coating the capsule after it was deposited. It was
not stated whether the o&ouml;theca was otherwise concealed. The female
remained with her body over the o&ouml;theca for several hours and drove
away other cockroaches which approached.</p>

<p>Sonan (1924) observed that <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Periplaneta
australasiae</i> spent from 40 minutes to an hour covering their o&ouml;thecae,
and that if the females were frightened away from this activity, they
returned again to complete it. As well as excavating holes in the substrate
in which to deposit its o&ouml;thecae, <i>P. americana</i> also avails itself
of readymade crevices of appropriate size (Ehrlich, 1943). Species of
<i>Epilampra</i> in Malaya were said by Annandale (1900) to deposit
their o&ouml;thecae in crevices in floating logs just above the water line.
However, Shelford (1906) stated that four genera (including <i>Epilampra</i>)
of the subfamily Epilamprinae are "viviparous," in which event
the females would carry their o&ouml;thecae within their bodies during
embryogenesis and would not place the o&ouml;thecae in crevices in logs.</p>

<p>The female of <i>Cryptocercus punctulatus</i> was observed to make a
groove in a piece of wood, then carry her o&ouml;theca 6 inches from where
she had dropped it and place it in the groove; she covered the o&ouml;theca
so that only a portion was visible (Cleveland <i>in</i> Cleveland et al.,
1934). Dr. W. L. Nutting (personal communication, 1954) collected a
number of o&ouml;thecae of <i>C. punctulatus</i> in the field and found each one
almost completely sealed off with bits of wood in a deep groove in the
roof of a chamber in a log. The keel of the o&ouml;theca was visible but the
rest was well camouflaged. He stated that "The adult pair usually
frequents the chamber at this time, while their broods of previous
years occupy neighboring galleries."</p>

<p>Berland (1924) observed a female of <i>Loboptera decipiens</i> filling a
hole (the abandoned nest of a hymenopteron) with earth that she
carried in her mouth; he later found her o&ouml;theca behind the earthen
barricade which she had erected.</p>

<p>In summary, the following species of oviparous cockroaches have
been observed concealing their o&ouml;thecae (only those references not
previously cited are given): <i>Blatta orientalis</i>; <i>Cryptocercus punctulatus</i>;
<i>Ectobius sylvester</i> (Harz, 1956, 1957); <i>Epilampra</i> sp.; <i>Eurycotis
floridana</i> (Roth and Willis, 1954a); <i>Loboptera decipiens</i>; <i>Balta
scripta</i>, <i>Methana curvigera</i>, <i>Methana marginalis</i>, and <i>Methana caneae</i>
(Pope, 1953a); <i>Pelmatosilpha marginalis</i>, <i>Pelmatosilpha purpurascens</i>,
and <i>Nauclidas nigra</i> (Bunting, 1956); <i>Periplaneta americana</i>
(Haber, 1919; Adair, 1923; Se&iacute;n, 1923; Nigam, 1933; Gould and
Deay, 1938; Rau, 1940a); <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> (Girault, 1915b;
Spencer, 1943; Pope, 1953); <i>Periplaneta brunnea</i> (Roth and Willis,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
unpublished data, 1958); <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i> (Gould and Deay,
1940); <i>Periplaneta ignota</i> (Pope, 1953); <i>Supella supellectilium</i>
(Flock, 1941). Undoubtedly other oviparous species that drop their
o&ouml;thecae long before the eggs hatch also make some attempt to conceal
the o&ouml;thecae by placing them in crevices or covering them with
debris.</p>

<p>Sometimes the o&ouml;thecae are deposited but not concealed. Hafez
and Afifi (1956) reported that in Egypt <i>Supella supellectilium</i> attaches
its o&ouml;theca to a suitable substrate with a gummy oral secretion
but leaves the egg capsule otherwise exposed. We (1954) have
noticed similar behavior in laboratory colonies of this species and of
<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, as have Gould and Deay (1940). Cornelius (1853)
stated that the female of <i>B. orientalis</i> takes care of the safety of her
offspring to the extent of usually dropping her o&ouml;thecae in places
which are dry and raised above the ground, although rarely one also
may find some o&ouml;thecae scattered on the ground. For lack of suitable
material females of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> sometimes did not conceal
their o&ouml;thecae (Nigam, 1933). Frequently in laboratory colonies
<i>P. americana</i> merely drops the o&ouml;thecae loosely in sand or food "in
contrast to <i>P. australasiae</i>, which almost always went to considerable
trouble to fasten their eggs securely and to conceal them with debris"
(Pope, 1953). If conditions under which <i>Nauclidas nigra</i> is kept are
not suitable, the female will drop her o&ouml;theca anywhere (Bunting,
1956). Rau (1940) stated that the female of <i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>
does not conceal her o&ouml;theca. However, Gould and Deay (1940)
stated that this species deposits its o&ouml;thecae loosely behind bark.
<i>Ellipsidion affine</i> and <i>Ellipsidion australe</i> attach their o&ouml;thecae to bark
or the underside of leaves but apparently make no attempt to conceal
them (Pope, 1953a).</p>

<p>The females of most of the above species have no further familial
association with their offspring. The eggs hatch with no attention
from the mother who is probably not even in the vicinity at that time.
The young apparently do not react to the presence of the parent, as
such, after hatching. This is not unexpected, as several additional
o&ouml;thecae may have been deposited by these oviparous females before
the eggs of the first o&ouml;thecae hatch. However, a different behavior is
encountered among species that do not form a second o&ouml;theca until
after the eggs of the first have hatched (see below) and in the so-called
colonial species.</p>

<p>Shaw (1925) reported that in Australia both <i>Panesthia australis</i>
and <i>Panesthia laevicollis</i> appear to live in families, and that one
usually finds a pair of adults associated with from 12 to 20 nymphs in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
different stages of development; he continued, "it is only where the
molts are very abundant that one loses sight of this familial habit."
Tillyard (1926) also stated that the Australian species of <i>Panesthia</i>
live in burrows in soil in strict family communities of a pair of adults
and 10 to 20 nymphs. A related colonial species, <i>Cryptocercus punctulatus</i>,
lives in both sound and rotten logs in colonies consisting of a
pair of adults and 15 or 20 nymphs, probably representing two or
three broods (Cleveland et al., 1934; Cleveland, 1948). Chopard
(1938) has cited this association as an example of gregariousness,
which it may well be; however, the presence of only one pair of
adults in each colony suggests a more intimate relationship.</p>

<p>Among species of <i>Blattella</i> and certain other genera with similar
reproductive habits the female carries her o&ouml;theca clasped in her
genital cavity with the posterior portion projecting behind her. Each
normal o&ouml;theca is carried for approximately the duration of embryogenesis
and is not dropped until, or shortly before, hatching. We have
seen (1954, fig. 65) newly hatched nymphs of <i>Blattella vaga</i> crawl
over the body of the mother who stood quietly near the dropped
o&ouml;theca; this female raised her wings and some of the nymphs
crawled under them onto the dorsal surface of her abdomen. The
nymphs seemed to feed on the grease covering the mother's body. The
association was short-lived, however, and soon the nymphs scattered.
Pettit (1940) stated that when hatching of <i>Blattella germanica</i> occurs
in the open (on a table top), the nymphs may remain near the capsule
only a few minutes. Ledoux (1945) found that newly hatched
nymphs of <i>B. germanica</i> remained together without shelter in a single,
sparse group. If the nymphs were separated by blowing on them, the
group quickly reassembled, usually in the same spot. Ledoux showed
that this gregarious grouping of first-instar nymphs was not necessarily
a familial association by placing nymphs from two o&ouml;thecae together.
In groups of 8 to 12 nymphs there was a perfect intermingling
of the offspring from the two different females.</p>

<p>It is among the so-called viviparous cockroaches that the greatest
number of observations have been made of postparturient associations
between female cockroaches and their offspring. The females of these
species carry their o&ouml;thecae in brood sacs within their bodies until
embryogenesis has been completed. This behavior ensures protection
of the young from desiccation and attack by parasites (Roth and
Willis, 1955a). (See Roth and Willis, 1958a, for an analysis of oviparity
and viviparity in the Blattaria.) Shelford (1906, 1916) reported
that he had captured a female of <i>Pseudophoraspis nebulosa</i> in
Borneo with numerous young nymphs clinging to the undersurface of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
her abdomen. He also recalled that there was in the Hope Museum
(Oxford) a female of <i>Phlebonotus pallens</i> to which the following
label was attached: "'Ceylon ... carries its young beneath its wing
covers. 1878.'" Pruthi (1933) found in South India another female
of <i>P. pallens</i> which was carrying over a dozen young nymphs on her
back beneath her wings. In his paper Pruthi reproduced a photograph
of this specimen with the light-colored nymphs in place on the back of
the female. Hanitsch (1933) reported having seen a museum specimen
from Luzon, Philippine Islands, of the apterous female of <i>Perisphaerus
glomeriformis</i> with nymphs still clinging to her undersurface;
he also reported having seen a museum specimen of a female of
<i>Ellipsidion variegatum</i> from Australia with four young clinging to the
upper side of the apex of her tegmina and six to the o&ouml;theca which
projected beyond her body. Presumably this specimen was giving
birth when captured. Gurney (1954; personal communication, 1958)
stated that specimens of <i>Perisphaerus</i> sp. from Mindanao and Luzon
have been found with young nymphs clinging to the middle and hind
coxae. The first-instar nymph has an elongate face and specialized
galeae. Karny (1925) also observed that at the slightest alarm the
young of some species of Phoraspidinae creep under the dome-shaped
front wings of the mother.</p>

<p>The newly hatched young of <i>Leucophaea maderae</i> have also been
seen congregated under the mother on several occasions. Se&iacute;n (1923)
stated that after being born, the nymphs of this species gather under
the mother and accompany her at night in her excursions in search of
food. Pess&ocirc;a and Corr&ecirc;a (1928) reported that "During the first days
the free larvae hide under the adult cockroach which becomes restless
and active in contrast to its usual slow gait." Wolcott (1950) stated
that "They are not only gregarious, but the mother broods over her
young, and together they sally forth at night in search for food, until
they are of such a size as to mingle with their elders."</p>

<p>The African mountain cockroach <i>Aptera fusca</i> has been observed
during late summer and early winter in familial groups beneath loose
bark, under stones, and in dead leaves (Skaife, 1954): "Each party
consists of a number of black young ones, together with one, two or
more adult females and perhaps a winged male or two. Later on
they scatter and live more or less solitary lives." In Malaya Karny
(1924) often found phoraspidine females between leaves surrounded
by about 20 young nymphs. He stated that one also often found females
of <i>Perisphaerus armadillo</i> surrounded by pale, yellowish-white
young; similarly he had observed that <i>Archiblatta hoevenii</i> was found
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
mostly in colonies made up of mothers and their young. The duration
of these associations is not known.</p>

<p>Saupe (1928) noticed that the newly hatched nymphs of <i>Blaberus
craniifer</i> (see footnote <a id="FNanchor_12_12a"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12a" class="fnanchor">12</a>, p. <a href="#Page_322">322</a>) collected together under the body
of their mother and stated that this is as pronounced a case of brood
care as Zacher had observed with <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>. Nutting
(1953) stated that "A degree of maternal solicitude is exhibited by
this roach [<i>B. craniifer</i>], for many times I have observed the female
to remain motionless for an hour or more with her unpigmented
brood clustered around and beneath her body." We, too, have observed
similar behavior in laboratory colonies of <i>B. craniifer</i> and
<i>Leucophaea maderae</i>.</p>

<p>Chopard (1950) noted that after hatching the young of <i>Gromphadorhina
laevigata</i> remained grouped around the female for some time;
the mother stood motionless, high on her legs, with her thorax curved
up to make room for the brood which hid under her body. We (unpublished
data, 1958) have seen young nymphs of <i>Gromphadorhina portentosa</i>
also stay near their mother for some time after birth; the
mother at this time produced a characteristic hissing sound when she
was only slightly disturbed by the movement of our hand near her and
her brood. The sound is produced as air is expelled through the second
abdominal spiracle. We have seen recently hatched nymphs of <i>Nauphoeta
cinerea</i> crawl beneath the mother, even under her wings, where
they remained about an hour (Willis et al., 1958). Bunting (1956)
observed a female of <i>Blaberus discoidalis</i> collect a mound of debris
into which she inserted the tip of her abdomen; he found young in
the mound later the same day. This female showed no maternal care
for the young after birth. Whole families of cockroaches may be
found in bromeliads in Brazil (Ohaus, 1900). Hebard (1920) observed
a colony of adults and young of <i>Dendroblatta sobrina</i> on a
tree trunk in the Panama Canal Zone.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Whether any of the above associations exemplify maternal care for
the newly hatched young is questionable. The behavior of the mother,
beyond placing her eggs in a suitable location, seems to be entirely
passive. The first-instar nymphs are the active partners in these
associations, and they may merely be seeking shelter under the nearest
convenient object rather than under the mother as such. More extensive
studies of some of these relationships will be needed before claims
for maternal care, as suggested by Scott (1929), can be substantiated.</p>


<h3>GREGARIOUSNESS</h3>

<p>Casual statements that cockroaches are gregarious are often encountered
in the literature. There has been some argument to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
effect that large numbers of these insects seeking the same environment
in a limited space would appear to be gregarious, whereas there
is probably no true social tendency (Rau, 1924). Reactions of cockroaches
to certain stimuli in the environment undoubtedly do result
in aggregations of individuals. However, as Chopard (1938) has
pointed out, it is difficult to assign the respective parts played in assembling
by the attraction of the milieu and by gregarious instincts.
Chopard (1938) also stated that Orthoptera with a gregarious tendency
are found rarely isolated; one finds them, on the contrary
nearly always collected in the same shelters, close together, as if conscious
of a need for contact between themselves. He continued
further that one can be tempted to attribute the assembling to taxes
but that interattraction equally plays an important role; for example,
if one places a large number of cockroaches in a container and offers
them similar shelters composed of cardboard tubes, one finds that
nearly all the individuals will assemble in one of the tubes, ignoring
the others. Pettit (1940) claimed that in <i>Blattella germanica</i> gregariousness
seemed to depend on the mutual attractiveness of body
secretions as well as a thigmopositive behavior and love of warmth.</p>

<p>Ledoux (1945) has studied experimentally gregariousness and social
interattraction in <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Blattella germanica</i>. He
also found that the cockroaches tended to collect in shelters containing
other cockroaches. He concluded that group formation is not the result
of chance, but is a social phenomenon, and that interattraction is
mainly olfactory, conditioned by (1) positive chemotaxis to odors
emitted by the cockroaches themselves, (2) positive hygrotaxis, and
(3) thigmotaxis. He found also that large groups are not stable and
tend to break into smaller groups.</p>

<p>Gregariousness in the Orthoptera varies in intensity according to
the species and within a species according to the age or physiological
state of the insects (Chopard, 1938). This is well exemplified by
several of the blattid species discussed below.</p>

<p>Gregarious groupings of cockroaches have been observed most frequently
among the domiciliary species. A few examples will suffice.
Gal'kov (1926) observed heavy infestations of undetermined cockroaches
in workers' living quarters in the Ural region: "In the corners
near the stove, the cockroaches covered the walls in a dense
carpet." After fumigating he collected about 135,000 dead cockroaches
from one barracks and about 475,000 from another. We
have reviewed a few other examples of heavy infestations in our
1957(a) paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Periplaneta americana</i> was observed by Gould and Deay (1938) in
an old meat-packing building in Indiana. Adult cockroaches were
present in large numbers between closely placed beams, but the
nymphs were more common in cracks between bricks. Clusters of
several hundred cockroaches were seen on the open walls of the cold,
dark hide room. Gould and Deay stated "American roaches of all
sizes live together in perfect harmony. Young nymphs have been
noted in clusters underneath adults and crawling over the adults as
they wander about in rearing jars." In the monkey house of the Hamburg
zoo, <i>P. americana</i> spent most of the day in the cellars resting on
the walls in groups of about 200 individuals (Brecher, 1929). Lederer
(1952) noted that in closed, dark, heated spaces under the aquarium
at Frankfurt am Main, <i>P. americana</i> rested in groups of 20 to 30
individuals; he stated that it was remarkable that the "herd" divided
itself into groups each of which usually contained insects of the same
age or stage of development. Eads (1954) found <i>P. americana</i> in 40
percent of 762 sewer manholes in Tyler, Tex.; 13 percent of 670 of
these manholes were heavily infested with 100 or more cockroaches
in each. Other heavy sewer infestations have been reviewed in our
1957(a) paper.</p>

<p>Ehrlich (1943) has stated that <i>Periplaneta americana</i> exhibits social
behavior. For instance, cockroaches of various ages inhabit a fairly
large space jointly; the adults and older nymphs sense approaches
with their antennae and warn and protect the young by a beating of
wings and by body movements. There is complete utilization of the
available living space; the imagos drive older nymphs from their
resting places, and the older nymphs drive out the younger ones, until
all cracks, depending on their size, are occupied by various age groups
of different sizes. In his experiments Ehrlich observed that in cages
with no hiding places the cockroaches would group together; when
given a choice of small and large shelters, <i>P. americana</i> hid only under
the larger ones that could shelter more insects. Finally, the cockroaches
ceased to bite and fight each other when they crowded together
in the face of danger.</p>

<p>Of <i>Blatta orientalis</i> Marlatt (1915) stated "This species is notably
gregarious in habit, individuals living together in colonies in the most
amicable way, the small ones being allowed by the larger ones to sit
on them, run over them, and nestle beneath them without any resentment
being shown." Haber (1919) also observed that this species is
often noticed "huddled together, the younger ones crawling over,
around, and beneath the older ones."</p>

<p>Wille (1920) observed that nymphs of <i>Blattella germanica</i> remained
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
almost constantly in groups during the first and second instars,
but less so during the third instar. He believed that the aggregations
of young occurred because they could occupy narrow crevices where
the larger insects could not penetrate. At usual room temperatures the
older nymphs and adults lived completely isolated, but at certain
temperatures they gathered together in large, tightly pressed groups.</p>

<p><i>Supella supellectilium</i> is said to be gregarious (Gould and Deay,
1940). The smaller nymphs aggregate in small groups in rearing
containers, but the older ones remain separate from one another
(Hafez and Afifi, 1956). <i>Leucophaea maderae</i> is sociable and rarely
found alone; in their favorite hiding places, hills of these cockroaches
can be seen hanging together (Se&iacute;n, 1923). Wolcott (1950) also
stated that <i>L. maderae</i> is gregarious. Annandale (1900) observed that
in the "Siamese Malay States" large colonies of <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>
conceal themselves in hollows of bamboo logs from which houses
are built. Moulton (1912) stated that he was astonished at the large
numbers of <i>P. australasiae</i> and <i>Symploce cavernicola</i> that he saw
swarming on the sides of caves of Mt. Jibong, Borneo.</p>

<p>Rehn and Hebard (1905) stated that in Key West, Fla., <i>Eurycotis
floridana</i> fairly swarmed under the coquina boulders in the woods, in
groups of a dozen containing both young and adults; <i>Pycnoscelus
surinamensis</i> was very abundant in the same type of habitat. Caudell
(1905) also found the young of <i>E. floridana</i> with the mature individuals.
Hebard (1917) in his discussion of <i>Lattiblattella rehni</i>
again mentioned finding frequent colonies of <i>E. floridana</i> in Florida.
He also found many specimens of <i>Blaberus craniifer</i> under boards on
the ground at Key West. He found <i>Parcoblatta lata</i> numerous under
bark of dead pine trees in Alabama. However, Dowdy (1955), in an
ecological study of oak-hickory forest in Missouri, stated that "<i>Parcoblatta</i>
[sp.] were never recorded as being gregarious, in fact they
were mostly solitary. However, in some cases two were found together."
Yet Blatchley (1895) stated of <i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>
that in the winter in Indiana "One cannot pull the loose bark from an
old log without dislodging a colony of from ten to a hundred of the
nymphs of various sizes." Males of <i>Parcoblatta virginica</i> were said
to be often gregarious beneath loose bark and under chunks and rubbish
(Blatchley, 1920).</p>

<p>Rehn and Hebard (1927) quoted observations made earlier by Hebard
on <i>Byrsotria fumigata</i> in Cuba: "I found the specimens under flat
stones, sometimes in colonies of 3 or 4 mature specimens and numbers
of immature individuals in all stages of development." These observers
also reported that <i>Aspiduchus borinquen</i> was found in Puerto
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Rico in a limestone cavern by thousands in the grass and on the walls.
J. W. H. Rehn (1951a) stated that a related species, apparently <i>Aspiduchus
cavernicola</i>, was seen in great numbers on the side walls and
roof of a cave in Puerto Rico, but it was not possible to collect any of
these and, we infer, confirm the species. Rehn and Hebard (1927)
in their account of <i>Simblerastes jamaicanus</i> reported finding it in
numbers in a termite nest. Pemberton and Williams (1938) stated
that <i>Diploptera punctata</i> is of gregarious habits in Hawaii. Saupe
(1928) observed a strong "herd instinct" in all age groups of <i>Blaberus
craniifer</i>. Bunting (personal communication, 1956) stated that large
nymphs and adults of <i>Blaberus discoidalis</i> "congregate in narrow
cracks or on the underside of some low object. The younger nymphs
keep in close communities of approximately the same age." Sonan
(1924) stated that in Formosa(?) <i>Salganea morio</i> is usually found in
groups of six or seven in decayed trees. Species of the genus <i>Litopeltis</i>
may be found in small groups as they are somewhat gregarious
(Rehn, 1928).</p>

<p>The physiological or psychological effects of gregariousness, or lack
of it, are interesting aspects of the basic phenomenon. Landowski
(1937) studied in <i>Blatta orientalis</i> the effect on development and
growth of the transition from life in complete isolation to life in
groups. He kept nymphs in groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 in jars of
identical size and shape. Landowski found that (1) mortality increased
with the size of the group and with age, as each animal occupied
more of the available space. [Presumably these factors are less
detrimental in nature where the group is unconfined.] He further
found that (2) life in complete isolation extended the time required
to produce an adult insect; and (3) the mean weight of the adult insect
was, generally, in inverse proportion to the number of nymphs
raised together; isolated insects usually attained the greatest adult
weight.</p>

<p>Similarly, Griffiths and Tauber (1942a) found that isolation extended
the period of nymphal development in <i>Periplaneta americana</i>.
As most of their isolates died before reaching maturity, these workers
concluded that the American cockroach does not thrive when individually
isolated and that several individuals must be together for
optimum development to occur. Pettit (1940, 1940a) observed that
isolated nymphs of <i>Blattella germanica</i> take longer to mature than
those reared in groups. Wallick (1954) found indications in <i>B.
germanica</i> that there is an inverse relationship between population
density and individual weight; as the population decreased the weight
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
increased. He also noted an inverse relationship between population
density and life expectancy in this species.</p>

<p>We (Willis et al., 1958) have confirmed the above observations that
<i>Blattella germanica</i>, <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, and <i>Periplaneta americana</i> complete
nymphal development in less time when reared in groups rather
than individually. We (loc. cit.) also found that nymphs of the
following additional species matured more quickly when reared in
groups: <i>Eurycotis floridana</i>, <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i>, <i>Supella supellectilium</i>,
<i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i>, and <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>; only a
very slight decrease in the average length of the developmental period
was found in grouped nymphs of <i>Leucophaea maderae</i>.</p>

<p>Wharton et al. (1954) observed that virgin adult males of <i>Periplaneta
americana</i> that had been individually isolated upon emergence
were almost wholly unresponsive to the sexually stimulating, female
odor for a test period of four weeks. Similar males of comparable age
that were kept in groups reacted strongly from the sixth day on. Removal
of reactive males from the group inhibited the reaction in these
isolates, but the response returned when the insects were regrouped.
We (1952) had similarly observed that no isolated male of <i>Blattella
germanica</i> was ever seen to give a courting response without having
received some form of external stimulation. Yet when numbers of
males were kept together isolated from females, on several occasions
the males became active and a few individuals gave a courting response.
As the sexual stimulus is received by the male of <i>B. germanica</i>
through contact rather than odor, as in <i>P. americana</i>, presumably it
was mutual contact between the grouped males that released the courting
activity.</p>

<p>Cloudsley-Thompson (1953a), in his studies of diurnal rhythms in
<i>Periplaneta americana</i>, observed a steady decline in total activity
in successive 24-hour cycles: "When two cockroaches, even of different
species (<i>P. americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i>) were kept together, this
depression did not appear to set in so readily." The associates apparently
kept each other active.</p>

<p>Isolated females of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> can be conditioned to
run a simple maze with less time and fewer errors per trial than when
paired or when a member of a group of three (Gates and Allee, 1933).
There was less activity, and accordingly fewer errors per minute,
among cockroaches tested as pairs and groups of three than as isolated
individuals. This observation should not be contrasted with that of
Cloudsley-Thompson (1953a), cited above, because the intervals
during which activity was observed were quite different.</p>

<p>In the above account we have presumed that aggregations of some
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
species are indications of gregariousness. However, until gregariousness
has been proved experimentally for each species, we concede that
reactions to environmental stimuli might be sufficient to bring about
some of the observed groupings without any interaction between individuals.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In concluding this section we note that Tepper (1893) stated that
carnivorous cockroaches in Australia lead more or less solitary lives,
and that one rarely meets several together in close proximity. Takahashi
(1940) observed that in Formosa <i>Blattella humbertiana</i> does
not have a tendency to throng together. Rau (1947) stated that the
adults of <i>Ischnoptera deropeltiformis</i> showed no tendency toward
gregariousness, but in the laboratory newly hatched young lived close
together under bark and remained together throughout the nymphal
stages. We wonder whether this gregariousness was not imposed by
the restricted quarters of the cage. As mentioned above, Dowdy
(1955) did not find <i>Parcoblatta</i> sp. to be gregarious in the field.</p>


<h3>INTRASPECIES FIGHTING</h3>

<p>Fighting occurs among cockroaches of the same species over food
or shelter or between males. Saupe (1928) observed late-instar
nymphs of <i>Blaberus craniifer</i> attack each other and even adults. Additional
records cited in the section on intraspecies predation (p. <a href="#Page_322">322</a>)
imply fighting within a species. Rau (1924) saw a male of <i>Blatta
orientalis</i> attack another male in copula and bite away a large portion
of its wing. Two other males in the container had their wings badly
torn overnight, presumably as a result of fighting.</p>

<p>Ehrlich (1943) stated that individuals of <i>Periplaneta americana</i>
that are feeding will ward off intruders by spreading their wings and
pushing with their hind legs. However, the intruder will approach
again and again biting the feeder in the legs and wings. Frequently
the odor of approaching food was sufficient to cause the cockroaches
to fight and bite each other. Biting and fighting also occurred when
individuals of this species defended their daytime hiding places. A
position of attack is assumed when two antagonistic individuals of
<i>P. americana</i> meet (Ehrlich, 1943, fig. 14). The insects raise their
bodies slightly above the ground, by extending their legs, and they
stretch their heads forward horizontally so that their mouth parts
protrude; when the insects jump at each other, they may wound each
other severely in the soft parts of the body. Fighting between sexually
excited males resulted in injury to their legs, wings, cerci, and other
parts of the body. Frequently an insect that could no longer defend
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
itself was killed. Lederer (1952) also made similar but less extensive
observations on fighting in this species.</p>

<p>Pettit (1940) quoted Woodruff as stating that nymphs of <i>Blattella
germanica</i>, apparently healthy and perfectly normal, would do battle
for no apparent cause other than a chance meeting, and that occasionally
the fight was to the finish, the loser being eaten. Pettit could not
substantiate such voracious attacks, although he saw nymphs engage
in fights lasting about two seconds during which one would be driven
off by vigorous bites on legs or cerci. Small nymphs of <i>B. germanica</i>
tended to ignore each other, but third-and later-instar nymphs would
engage in "quarrels" of short duration when two met. Pettit noted
that males of <i>B. germanica</i> that were crowded together quickly set
upon, but did not always kill, other cockroaches introduced into their
cage. When he isolated a dozen males in a small cage, they became
quarrelsome and three of the group were killed and partly eaten.
After several days the surviving males had taken positions so that each
was equidistant from his neighbors. Some of these males attacked
other males and a female that were introduced, by biting their legs
and cerci. Females under similar conditions were much less aggressive,
although Pettit saw some females that roved about biting all large
members of the group that were within easy reach.</p>

<p class="pmb3">We have frequently observed aggressive behavior between males of
<i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i>, which resulted in torn wings. The males would
wrestle with each other rolling over and over.</p>


<h3>INTERSPECIES COMPATIBILITY</h3>

<p>We agree in essence with Chopard (1938) who stated that it is improper
to speak of associations apropos of the ecological distribution
of Orthoptera. He continued that it is clearly evident that different
species of Orthoptera, which are found grouped on a territory more
or less narrowly limited, have no interdependence among them. Their
grouping results uniquely from almost similar reactions to the different
factors which characterize this limited milieu. There is neither
interdependence nor interaction; the grouping is a false biocoenose,
born under the action of the environment, and does not survive a
modification of this milieu.</p>

<p>However, as there are numerous examples of mutual toleration between
different species as well as examples of incompatibility, the subject
has more than academic interest even if no true ecological
significance. On the other hand, further study may show that certain
of these associations are definitely ecological, particularly among the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
feral species. As might be expected, most of the following examples
pertain to domiciliary cockroaches.</p>

<p>Dozier (1920) occasionally found <i>Periplaneta americana</i> with
<i>Eurycotis floridana</i> in decaying stumps, beneath loose bark of decayed
trees, and beneath corded wood. Adair (1923) stated that in
his house in Egypt <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, and <i>Blattella
germanica</i> were found together in a cupboard. Sambon (1925)
found <i>B. orientalis</i> and <i>B. germanica</i> side by side but not fraternizing
in a home in Italy. Gould and Deay (1938) observed that apartments
over stores were infested with both <i>B. germanica</i> and <i>P. americana</i>,
but did not indicate whether these occupied the same microhabitat.
Gould and Deay (1940) observed that in the Purdue University
greenhouse <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i> was found "under benches, boxes,
pots and other objects in association with the American roach." Dr.
L. A. Hetrick (personal communication, 1954) wrote us that several
summers before he had had a mixed infestation of cockroaches, which
included <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>, <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i>, and <i>Pycnoscelus
surinamensis</i>, in his chicken shed.</p>

<p>Eads (personal communication, 1955), in response to our inquiry
about the mixed populations of cockroaches that he had reported infesting
sewers in Texas (Eads et al., 1954), stated that "Each of the
ten colonies of <i>B. orientalis</i> found in Tyler manholes were associated
with larger colonies of <i>P. americana</i>. True breeding colonies of <i>B.
orientalis</i> appeared to be present since all the developmental stages
were taken. The same situation existed with the <i>P. fuliginosa</i> and the
two species of <i>Parcoblatta</i>. Larger colonies of <i>P. americana</i> were
associated with the other species in each case. From our limited observations
the two species always appeared to be perfectly compatible."
Eads et al. (1954) had found <i>Periplaneta fuliginosa</i> in three
manholes, <i>Parcoblatta bolliana</i> in one manhole and <i>Parcoblatta pensylvanica</i>
in one manhole. We assume that the groups of each species
were spacially discrete so that they were recognizable as colonies.
Dr. T. A. Olson (personal communication, 1958) has observed two or
more species of cockroaches in a single structure but never in mixed
colonies. Each species was separated physically from the others. Olson
concluded that cockroaches of different species do not mingle freely
unless forced to do so by some special environmental condition. Pettit
(1940) found <i>B. germanica</i> and <i>P. americana</i> similarly separated in
the same building or even in the same basement laboratory.</p>

<p>Perkins (1899) found <i>Lobopterella dimidiatipes</i> generally living in
company with the young of <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> in Hawaii. Rehn
and Hebard (1914) in Florida found <i>P. australasiae</i> abundant with
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
<i>Periplaneta americana</i> on a quarter-boat. They also noted that the
forficulid <i>Marava</i> [= <i>Prolabia</i>] <i>arachidis</i> (Yersin) appeared in
numbers in a kitchen after dark accompanied by swarms of <i>P. americana</i>.
These workers also found <i>Leurolestes pallidus</i> in a fruit store
in Key West "where the species was common in a pile of old burlap
bags and in cracks under the stands which it shared with one fairly
large colony of <i>Blattella germanica</i>, occasional specimens of <i>Holocompsa
nitidula</i>, a few specimens of <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, and one
specimen of <i>Supella supellectilium</i>." They also found <i>H. nitidula</i> with
<i>Blaberus craniifer</i> "between old boards in a woodshed, where nymphs
were more numerous than adults."</p>

<p>Rehn and Hebard (1914) stated of <i>Supella supellectilium</i> in Florida
that "The females were all taken in cupboards where <i>Blattella germanica</i>
was found in swarms." The association in human habitations
of <i>S. supellectilium</i> and <i>B. germanica</i> has been reported also by Sein
(1923), Puerto Rico; Shaw (1924), Australia; Mallis (1954):
"German and brown-banded roaches were often found in the same
crevice."; Anonymous (1958), Texas; and Anonymous (1958a),
Georgia. Gould and Deay (1940) stated that other species of cockroaches,
especially <i>B. germanica</i>, may be found with <i>S. supellectilium</i>
in the same part of a building. Yet Shaw (1925) stated that "when
<i>Supella supellectilium</i> Serv. invades places already occupied by <i>Blattella
germanica</i> L., it tends to oust the latter."</p>

<p><i>Blaberus discoidalis</i> has been found in homes or in fruit debris in
Puerto Rico in company with the more common, domiciliary species
<i>Leucophaea maderae</i>, but never in abundance (Sein, 1923; Wolcott,
1950). Illingworth (1915) in Hawaii found <i>Symploce hospes</i> associated
with <i>Nauphoeta cinerea</i>, <i>Graptoblatta notulata</i>, and <i>Diploptera
punctata</i>.</p>

<p>Hebard (1917) found <i>Aglaopteryx diaphana</i> in a bromeliad on a
forest tree in Jamaica together with <i>Nyctibora laevigata</i> and numerous
<i>Cariblatta insularis</i>. He also found numerous <i>Aglaopteryx gemma</i>
under signs on longleaf pines in Alabama with occasional specimens
of <i>Parcoblatta lata</i>. In Virginia he found <i>Parcoblatta uhleriana</i> in a
decaying chestnut log with <i>Cryptocercus punctulalus</i>. In Florida he
found <i>Latiblattella rehni</i> with <i>Eurycotis floridana</i> and, more rarely,
with <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> under bark of pine trees. In Key West
he found <i>Symploce hospes</i> in the cupboard of a hotel with swarms of
<i>Blattella germanica</i> and a few <i>Supella supellectilium</i>.</p>

<p>Rehn and Hebard (1927) in their study of West Indian blattids
reported finding <i>Neoblattella proserpina</i> in epiphytic bromeliads in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Jamaica in company with <i>Neoblattella eurydice</i> and <i>Neoblattella dryas</i>.
They also list most of the associations cited by Hebard (1917).</p>

<p>Ramme (1923) reported that he found in Germany four species of
<i>Ectobius</i> (<i>lapponicus</i>, <i>lucidus</i>, <i>pallidus</i>, and <i>sylvester</i>) living together
in an area about 50 m. by 200 m. Although he had stated that his
specimens of <i>E. lucidus</i> were a distinct species in 1923, Ramme
(1951) later decided that they were a form of <i>E. sylvester</i>, <i>E. sylvester</i>
f. <i>lucidus</i>.</p>

<p>Dow (1955) reported trapping <i>Blattella germanica</i>, <i>Periplaneta
americana</i>, and <i>Periplaneta brunnea</i> in houses and privies in south
Texas. At our request Dr. Dow (personal communication, 1958)
analyzed his records to determine whether there were indications of
associations between these species, with the following results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As stated in my published note, the roaches were at first classified to genus
only. The 83 <i>Periplaneta</i> subsequently identified to species represented 28 different
collections, 11 from houses and 17 from privies, all in Pharr, Texas. Tabulation
of the data shows first that <i>P. americana</i> was taken only once in a house
and that <i>P. brunnea</i> was taken only 4 times in privies. Of course this distribution
greatly reduces the probability that they would be caught together, and it is not
surprising that <i>P. americana</i> was trapped alone in the single house collection.
<i>P. brunnea</i>, however, was trapped with <i>P. americana</i> 2 of the 4 times it
occurred in privy collections.</p>

<p>To investigate the occurrence of <i>Periplaneta</i> with and without <i>Blattella</i>, an
analysis has been made of 560 trap collections taken in 40 houses and 40 associated
privies in Pharr, Texas, in weekly intervals (from May 14 to June 23
[1948]). In the houses, <i>Periplaneta</i> and <i>Blattella</i> were caught in the same jar
26 times, <i>Periplaneta</i> alone 12 times, <i>Blattella</i> alone 83 times, and neither
genus 159 times. In a fourfold table, the value of chi-square (14.7) is significant
and indicates that the frequencies are not proportional. The number of times
<i>Periplaneta</i> and <i>Blattella</i> actually occurred together (26) is, however, much
larger than the expected number calculated from the row and column frequencies
(14.8). In the privies, <i>Periplaneta</i> and <i>Blattella</i> were caught in the same jar
9 times, <i>Periplaneta</i> alone 50 times, <i>Blattella</i> alone 18 times, and neither genus
203 times. In a fourfold table, the value of chi-square (1.95) is not significant
but the same type of disproportion is evident and the expected frequency of both
genera in one trap is 5.7, lower than the actual frequency of 9. Both immature
and adult roaches are included in this analysis.</p>

<p>The above evidence would be more satisfactory if based on more extensive
data. There is also a possible objection in that the traps were operated for at
least overnight, during which time one species could theoretically supplant
another. Of course, it is doubtful that there is anything involved here like territory
(in the ornithologists' sense). On the other hand, it is well to consider
that <i>Periplaneta</i> and <i>Blattella</i> are both likely to be more abundant in the same
type of favorable location and that this factor might offset in part some direct
antagonism between the species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="pmb3">The only known specimen of <i>Ischnoptera podoces</i> was captured in
company with the type series of <i>Cariblatta nebulicola</i>, in dead leaf
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
litter in Jamaica (Rehn and Hebard, 1927). In Florida <i>Periplaneta
australasiae</i> was often taken in company with <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>
and <i>Eurycotis floridana</i> (Blatchley, 1920).</p>


<h3>INTERSPECIES ANTAGONISM</h3>

<p>In contrast to the presumably amicable associations mentioned
above, other observations in the literature seem to indicate that some
species of cockroaches are incompatible when they attempt to occupy
the same habitat niche. Marlatt (1915) stated "Rarely do two of the
domestic species occur together in the same house. Often, also, of two
neighboring districts one may be infested with one species, while in
the other a distinct species is the commoner one. The different species
are thus seemingly somewhat antagonistic, and it is even supposed that
they may prey upon one another, the less numerous species being
often driven out." Phelps (1924) stated "Roaches of different species
are rarely found together, although roaches of the same species live
together on very amicable terms."</p>

<p>In 1859 Darwin (1887) stated that "In Russia the small Asiatic
cockroach [<i>Blattella germanica?</i>] has everywhere driven before it its
great congener [<i>Blatta orientalis?</i>]." Yet in France Girard (1877)
suggested that the oriental cockroach be introduced into a restaurant
infested with the German cockroach as the best way to expel the latter,
because the more robust species drives away cockroaches of smaller
size. Wille (1920) in Germany found usually only one species of
cockroach in a house. Yet when he placed <i>B. orientalis</i> and <i>B. germanica</i>
together, there were no reciprocal attacks even by hungry individuals.
Wille concluded that because of their greater speed, smaller
size, greater number of eggs, and faster development, the German
cockroaches eat the available food and so make the environment unfavorable
for the oriental. However, he noted that cases may be seen
in which the opposite is also possible. Laing (1946; British Museum
[Natural History], 1951) observed that in the British Isles <i>B. orientalis</i>
seems to have lost its dominant position to <i>B. germanica</i> in
recent years; it was stated that these species are not as a rule found
together and that the greater rapidity of breeding and ability to climb
of <i>B. germanica</i>, as well as the layout of modern buildings, are some
of the factors that favor the spread of <i>B. germanica</i>. Ledoux (1945)
found that first-instar nymphs of <i>B. germanica</i> and fourth-instar
nymphs of <i>B. orientalis</i>, adults of <i>B. germanica</i> and sixth-instar
nymphs of <i>B. orientalis</i>, as well as adults of both species, did not form
mixed groups. However, when he combined fifth-and sixth-instar
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
nymphs of <i>B. germanica</i> with fourth-and fifth-instar nymphs of <i>B.
orientalis</i>, which are all practically of equal size, sometimes he would
find mixed groups, but generally the groups were distinct. Lucas
(1912) stated that Burr had found <i>B. germanica</i> and <i>B. orientalis</i>
swarming within a rubbish heap in England; presumably both colonies
were breeding and multiplying and one species was not detrimental to
the presence of the other.</p>

<p>Shaw (1925) claimed that <i>Supella supellectilium</i> tended to oust
<i>Blattella germanica</i>, but Pope (1953) thought it doubtful in Queensland.
Wolcott (1950) stated that "The larger and more powerful
domestic cockroaches, <i>Periplaneta americana</i> (L.), <i>P. australasiae</i>
(F.) and <i>P. brunnea</i> Burmeister have very definitely fallen behind
in Puerto Rico in competition with the little German roach."
Pess&ocirc;a and Cor&ecirc;a (1928) observed that other species of cockroaches
were rare in Brazil in houses that were infested with <i>Leucophaea
maderae</i>. Lederer (1952) noticed that in the reptile house of the
aquarium at Frankfort am Main <i>Blatta orientalis</i> was obviously kept
down by <i>Blattella germanica</i>, even before the appearance of <i>P. americana</i>.
However, <i>B. germanica</i> was not driven out of the reptile house
by <i>P. americana</i> although the populations of each fluctuated for about
22 years after the American cockroach had settled there; both species
occupied separate resting places. Lederer further observed that within
four years of the introduction of <i>P. americana</i> into the crocodile
house, none of the original infestation of <i>B. orientalis</i> could be found;
a small colony of <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> in the reptile house was
apparently also driven out by <i>P. americana</i>. Chopard (1932, 1938)
stated that the oriental cockroach does not exist in company with <i>P.
americana</i> which very probably destroys it. Pettit (1940) kept <i>B.
germanica</i> and <i>P. americana</i> together in a cage for several weeks but
neither species gave any indication of feeding on the other.</p>

<p>Froggatt (1906) stated that "It is probable that the advent of the
larger and more formidable American cockroach into Australia has
led to the retirement or destruction of our indigenous species" [presumably
<i>Periplaneta australasiae</i>]. Tillyard (1926) noted that this
statement is incorrect as neither species is native to Australia. Yet
Shaw (1925) stated that in Australia "When both species live together
in the same places, <i>australasiae</i> Fabr. will probably be found gradually
to displace <i>americana</i> L." Local fluctuations in the relative abundance
of these species could be a basis for such dissimilar observations.
However, MacDougall (1925) observed that in the plant houses of
the Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh, the Australian cockroach
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
seemed to have overcome the American which had been more numerous
in former years.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In conclusion, we emphasize that many of the above observations
are merely tentative impressions gathered by workers who have
watched many species of cockroaches in nature. Obviously, additional
observations coupled with appropriate experimentation will be needed
to disclose the true structure of each presumed association and to resolve
apparent discrepancies. Although we are greatly indebted to
the cited authors for their contributions to the known information,
we anticipate that future results of cleverly designed laboratory experiments
will do much to dispel the uncertainty that still surrounds
our knowledge of the relations of the Blattaria to each other.</p>

<p>There are very few records indicating that cockroaches are unaccepted
as food by other animals. Hutson (1943) found that the duck,
guinea fowl, and pigeon would not normally eat <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>,
and in his experiments with the chicken eye worm he had to
force-feed his birds with infected cockroaches. Lederer (1952)
found that insectivorous birds in the Zoological Garden, Frankfurt
am Main, either refused hardened (as opposed to teneral) American
cockroaches or ate them unwillingly. Carpenter (1925) reported that
a monkey (<i>Cercopithecus</i>) failed to feed on cockroaches and suggested
that the insects' odor made them repugnant; however, there
are a number of positive records of monkeys feeding on cockroaches
(see pp. <a href="#Page_284">284</a>-<a href="#Page_286">286</a>).</p>

<p>Cockroaches may escape capture by predators through evasive behavior,
concealment, protective coloration, mimicry, or secretion of
malodorous materials. Nocturnal cockroaches may avoid predators
that are active during the day (Crawford, 1934), but nocturnal predators
are apparently quite successful in capturing cockroaches. Some
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
cockroaches may be protected by their swiftness, others by their resemblance
to vegetation (Williams, 1928). The habit of squeezing
into narrow cracks may afford cockroaches some protection.</p>

<p>Burrowing forms such as <i>Pycnoscelus</i> may spend much time in
underground cells (Roeser, 1940). Polyphagids rapidly burrow into
sand (Fausek, 1906), where they may be protected from predators.
Tepper (1893) discovered that a very large Australian cockroach,
<i>Geoscapheus robustus</i>, had its fore legs, especially the tibiae, adapted
for digging. He observed this species in captivity and in 1894 reported
that it appeared to sink into the soil without raising any considerable
amount above the surface and that it did not form an unobstructed
tunnel. Another large Australian cockroach, <i>Macropanesthia
rhinocerus</i>, burrows about two feet below the surface of sandy soil;
it also makes nests among pine roots and the nymphs rarely appear
above ground (Henson <i>in</i> Day, 1950). Tepper (1893) observed that
Australian cockroaches of the genera <i>Epilampra</i> and <i>Oniscosoma</i>
buried themselves in loose soil and dust. Baker (<i>in</i> Rehn, 1930) observed
that <i>Styphon bakeri</i> is found in humus and rubble in the Dutch
West Indies where "It is sluggish in the open, but wedges into the
humus quite quickly."</p>

<p><i>Therea nuptialis</i>, found in India, conceals itself at the roots of fig
trees, etc. The small hairs on its elytra retain sufficient dust to conceal
it, or at any rate to render it inconspicuous, when not on the wing
(Annandale, <i>in</i> Chopard, 1924c). Rehn and Hebard (1914) observed
that the nymphs of <i>Blaberus craniifer</i><a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> at Key West, Fla., "were
usually found half buried in loose damp earth under boards, where
they remained motionless, looking much like lumps of earth (with
which they were usually much dusted) until disturbed." Hebard
(1917) reported of <i>Monastria biguttata</i> from Brazil that "All of the
juveniles are heavily coated with foreign particles" which adhere
"to a multitude of closely placed, minute and usually curved spines,
which cover the dorsal surface and marginal portions of the ventral
surface."</p>

<p>It is apparent from the numbers of predators reported herein that
many animals are not deterred by the odorous secretions of cockroaches;
these secretions, because they may seem repugnant to man,
are often claimed to be repellent to predators. However, Cott (1940)
points out that "There are many instances in which protective devices
and associated warning colours are known to be ineffectual against
certain enemies. But this does not necessarily imply that they are not
on the whole beneficial to the species attacked." Certain cockroach
secretions may well be repellent to many predators, but as this is a
purely negative aspect of the predator-prey relationship little thus far
has been observed or published. Potential prey that successfully defends
itself against attack is never found in a predator's stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>Cockroaches have a variety of glands which secrete odorous materials.
Certain secretions, produced by tergal or dorsal glands in
males, are involved in sexual behavior; the females feed on the secretion
from these glands prior to copulating (Roth and Willis, 1954).
However, other secretions which are produced by both sexes are
ejected or given off when the insect is disturbed; undoubtedly these
are defensive weapons that are used against predators. Very few
experiments or observations are on record to show how effective these
secretions may be in protecting the cockroach. Although the morphology
of some of the glands has been described, relatively little is
known about the chemistry of their secretions.</p>

<p>Many species of Australian cockroaches have been reported to
emit "disgusting" odors, though the glands producing these secretions
have not been described, nor is the chemistry of the compounds known.
<i>Cosmozosteria lateralis</i> exposed two orange-red spots on the abdomen
while emitting a pungent odor which deterred a collector from
capturing it (Shelford, 1912). Another Australian species, <i>Platyzosteria
castanea</i>, when disturbed on barren ground tilts forward on
the vertex and straddles out the posterior legs, supporting itself in a
vertical position on the head and tarsi; in assuming this attitude it
will squirt a foetid fluid as a fine spray for a distance of 6 or 7 inches
(Shaw, 1914). Spencer (1892) mentions the pungent odor given off
by a cockroach which had been accidentally cut in two. Rageau
(1956) stated that in the New Hebrides and New Caledonia <i>Cutilia
nitida</i> emits, when disturbed, a corrosive liquid with an extremely disagreeable
odor.</p>

<p>The adults of <i>Eurycotis floridana</i> emit an odorous fluid when
seized (Rehn and Hebard, 1905). The fluid, which may irritate
sensitive skin areas, may be ejected as a spray for a distance of several
inches. This secretion has been identified as 2-hexenal (Roth et al.,
1956), and the ventral abdominal glands which produce it have been
described (Stay, 1957). Eisner (personal communication, 1958) has
found that the toad <i>Bufo marinus</i> and the frog <i>Rana pipiens</i> invariably
spit out adults of <i>E. floridana</i> which they have seized. The
odor of 2-hexenal was strongly apparent after these attacks, and the
insect was never damaged. However, the lizard <i>Anolis equestris</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
seized and crushed <i>E. floridana</i> before releasing its hold and dropping
the insect 5 to 10 minutes later. The blue jay <i>Cyanocitta cristata</i>
readily attacked adults of <i>E. floridana</i> and killed them but did not
eat the insects until after the odor had dissipated; however, the bird
carried nymphs of <i>E. floridana</i> to its perch and ate them. Nymphs
of this species do not secrete 2-hexenal (Roth et al., 1956). Recently,
2-hexenal has been tested for its antibacterial activity and has been
found to be active against seven species of pathogenic bacteria (Valcurone
and Baggini, 1957). <i>Eurycotis decipiens</i> from Trinidad also
ejects a fluid which may produce toxic symptoms such as vertigo and
nausea (Bunting <i>in</i> Roth and Willis, 1957a).</p>

<p>Large reservoirs of glands similar in appearance and position to
those of <i>Eurycotis floridana</i> are present in the adults of both sexes of
<i>Neostylopyga rhombifolia</i> and <i>Platyzosteria novae seelandiae</i>. Walker
(1904) and Longstaff (<i>in</i> Shelford, 1912) noted that the latter species
had a strong odor. Roth (unpublished data, 1957) found that the secretion
of <i>P. novae seelandiae</i> when ejected is grayish or milky in color. In
the reservoirs of the ventral gland of this insect the secretion is a milky
liquid containing floating greenish globules. Both infrared and mass
spectrographic analyses show that the secretion is a mixture containing
2-hexenal, the aldehyde that is found in <i>E. floridana</i>. Eisner (personal
communication, 1958) observed that the lizard <i>Anolis carolinensis</i> immediately
released <i>Neostylopyga rhombifolia</i> without injury, but that
<i>Bufo marinus</i>, <i>Anolis equistris</i>, and <i>Cyanocitta cristata</i> ate the insect
despite the secretion; several unidentified spiders and the ant <i>Pogonomyrmex
badius</i> were not repelled by the secretion of <i>N. rhombifolia</i>.</p>

<p>Dorsal and ventral glands have been found in both sexes of <i>Blatta
orientalis</i> and <i>Periplaneta americana</i> (Minchin, 1888, 1890; Kul'vets,
1898; Oettinger, 1906; Harrison, 1906; Liang, 1956). The ventral
glands are found in the same general region as those of <i>Eurycotis</i>.
We have also found similar ventrally located glands in both <i>Periplaneta
australasiae</i>, and <i>P. brunnea</i>. The reservoirs which store the
secretion of the ventral glands are smaller in <i>Blatta</i> and <i>Periplaneta</i>
spp. than those found in <i>Eurycotis</i>, <i>Neostylopyga</i>, or <i>Platyzosteria</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Blatta orientalis</i> the dorsal glands can be everted by pressure on
the abdomen; the secretion in these glands, according to Haase
(1889), has the typical oriental cockroach odor. Although the dorsal
glands of the oriental cockroach are usually given a defensive role
(Haase, 1889, 1889a; Kul'vets, 1898; Oettinger, 1906; Kon&#269;ek,
1924), the functions of secretions of these nonepigamic dorsal glands
and the ventral glands are still open to question. It is possible that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
some of the odors produced by cockroaches have functions other than
defense or sex attraction. For example, Ledoux (1945) showed that
the species odor is largely responsible for the gregarious behavior
shown by <i>Blatta orientalis</i> and <i>Blattella germanica</i>. The olfactory
stimulus acts over a short distance only, and the source of this odor
in the insect is unknown. By washing <i>Blattella germanica</i> in warm
chloroform Dusham (1918) extracted a wax which had the odor of
the German cockroach. However, there is no evidence to show that
cockroaches respond to the same cockroach odors that are detected by
man.</p>

<p>Certain cockroaches have recently been found to have odorous
secretions which are produced in tracheal glands. In <i>Diploptera punctata</i>
the tracheae leading to the second abdominal spiracles of nymphs
and adults are modified into odoriferous glands which produce a mixture
of 2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone; 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone; and
<i>para</i> benzoquinone; this material is ejected as a means of defense.
The offensive odor emitted by adults and nymphs of <i>Leucophaea
maderae</i> also issues from the second abdominal spiracles (Roth and
Stay, 1958).</p>

<p><i>Diploptera</i> is capable of ejecting its quinones from either its right
or left tracheal gland according to which side of the insect is attacked
(pl. <a href="#plate_36">36</a>, A-B). Eisner (1958) found that the secretion repelled the
ant <i>Pogonomyrmex badius</i> (Latreille) (pl. <a href="#plate_36">36</a>, C) and the beetle
<i>Galerita janus</i> Fabricius when they attacked the cockroach. The
spider <i>Lycosa helluo</i> Walckenaer was repelled by large nymphs and
adults of <i>D. punctata</i> but young nymphs were usually eaten promptly
(Eisner, 1958).</p>

<p>Bordas (1901, 1908) believed that the "conglobate" gland (Miall
and Denny, 1886), found in males of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Blatta
orientalis</i>, was an odoriferous gland used for defense, but Gupta
(1947) has shown that in all probability this gland (the phallic gland)
secretes the outermost covering of the spermatophore.</p>

<p>What appears to be mimicry occurs in some species of Blattaria.
The nymphs of many Panchlorini and Blaberinae vaguely resemble
sow bugs (Chopard, 1938). Certain members of the Perisphaerini
(e.g., <i>Perisphaerus glomeriformis</i>) from the Malayan region which
resemble sow bugs (Annandale, 1900; Hanitsch, 1915) can roll themselves
up into a ball thus hiding their antennae and legs (Lucas,
1862). Although these cockroaches are found among dead leaves or
under stones, in places in which sow bugs are also found, the benefit
to either or both forms is questionable; Annandale (1900) believed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
that the crustacean and the cockroach, living under similar conditions,
developed the same general body shape. Rolling up into a ball is
nothing more than an exaggeration of a reflex common to many young
cockroaches, that is, an arched position which these insects assume
when they immobilize themselves in response to certain stimuli
(Chopard, 1938).</p>

<p>There are cockroaches that resemble various Coleoptera and Hemiptera
(Belt, 1874; Shelford, 1912; Hanitsch, 1915). Some look like
cerambycids, lampyrids, coccinellids, pentatomids, etc. Perhaps the
most striking examples are the resemblances of cockroaches in the
genus <i>Prosoplecta</i> of the Epilamprinae to beetles of the family Coccinellidae;
Shelford (1912) has figured a number of species of <i>Prosoplecta</i>
together with the species of beetles which they seem to have
taken for models. Williams (1928) mentioned diurnal cockroaches
which by a combination of markings, shape, posture, and active flight
about vegetation suggest certain wasps.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Unfortunately, practically nothing is known about the behavior of
these so-called mimics and models or their relationships with predators
in the field. For the most part, the examples are based on a comparison
of pinned insects from museum collections (Burr, 1899); for
this reason Chopard (1938) believed that not much value should be
placed on superficial resemblances of this kind. However, we believe
that a lack of knowledge of cockroach mimicry is not a valid reason
for rejecting the idea that mimicry, if it occurs, may be of some benefit
in the survival of mimetic species. Certainly Cott's (1940) voluminous
compilation of the literature on adaptive coloration should
make the most skeptic hesitate to conclude dogmatically that these instances
of mimicry are merely accidental and meaningless.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="XIX_THE_BIOLOGICAL_CONTROL_OF_COCKROACHES">XIX. THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF COCKROACHES</a></h2>

<p class="minor">In the Navy [Japanese] a seaman who has captured 300
cockroaches will be granted one day special shore leave. They call
it "shore leave for cockroaches." The purpose is to promote extermination
of cockroaches in a warship because, on the one hand,
any warship suffers from numerous cockroaches, and, on the other
hand, any seaman likes shore leave.... The formalities for a
shore leave for cockroaches are as follows. A seaman keeps
cockroaches which he captured (mainly <i>B. germanica</i>, because
<i>P. americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i> are seldom found in Japan) in
a bottle or in a bag until the number reaches 300. Then he brings
them to the deck officer to get the confirmation that he has actually
captured more than 300 cockroaches. If the deck officer confirms it,
the seaman goes to a cabin where a petty officer reports that the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p class="minor">deck officer confirmed the number of cockroaches. The petty officer
signs the seaman's name, name of division, rank, and date to be
on shore leave in the log book for cockroach shore leaves. The
petty officer brings the log book again to the deck officer to get his
approval and then goes to the commander for the final approval.
In the Navy, they have another special shore leave for rats. In
this system, a seaman gets one day shore leave for one rat. The
formalities for the latter are the same as for the former, and there
is a log book for the rat shore leave in the petty officer's quarters.
The author took advantage of these systems frequently.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Little is known of the effects of predatism and parasitism on
natural populations of cockroaches. Many statements in the literature
are very general; yet there are a few data on egg parasites (e.g.,
<i>Tetrastichus hagenowii</i>) which suggest that, in the absence of parasites,
populations of domestic cockroaches might be much larger than
they are in certain areas. We have summarized the literature on
natural control and also that on the use by man of predators and parasites
in the biological control of cockroaches. However, because of the
paucity of information, we have been unable to evaluate the effectiveness
of biological control in reducing the numbers of pest cockroaches.
This is an area that might reward further investigation.</p>


<h3>INVERTEBRATES</h3>

<p><i>Scorpions.</i>&mdash;In Puerto Rico, cockroaches are probably the principal
food of the scorpions which live in old houses, on tree trunks, etc.
(Se&iacute;n, 1923). The staple diet of scorpions in Arizona is the small
cockroach commonly known as the water bug (Stahnke, 1949); in
the part of Arizona where he resides, Stahnke (personal communication,
1953) says that the "water-bug" is most generally <i>Supella
supellectilium</i> although <i>Blattella germanica</i> is also found, but less
abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Spiders.</i>&mdash;Jefferys (1760) mentioned a large spider which was protected
in the Antilles and especially on Guadeloupe because it hunted
down and fed on cockroaches; the spider was reputed to be common
in every house. Sir Hans Sloane (1725, <i>in</i> Cowan, 1865) reported
that residents of Jamaica kept spiders in their houses to destroy cockroaches.
Takahashi (1924) reported that, in the Taihoku area of
Formosa, human habitations contained large numbers of spiders which
caught and ate cockroaches. Smith (<i>in</i> Marlatt, 1915) reported that
Brazilians encourage large house spiders because they tend to rid the
house of "other insect pests." In British Guiana tarantulas were kept
in a bungalow to control <i>Periplaneta</i> and <i>Pycnoscelus</i> (Beebe, 1925a).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ants.</i>&mdash;A Madam Merian noticed that ants cleared houses of cockroaches
(Kirby and Spence, 1822). A small reddish-yellow ant,
called Pucchu&ccedil;i&ccedil;i by Peruvian Indians, pursued and destroyed a cockroach
called Chilicabra which was a pest in native huts (Tschudi,
1847). Schwabe (1950b) found swarms of ants attacking living
<i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i> and stated that ants are probably the chief
enemy of this cockroach in Hawaii. Wallace (1891) stated that in
Africa a band of driver ants may enter a house and clear it of cockroaches
and other arthropods. In British Guiana, Beebe, (1925)
found that several times a year army ants cleared the laboratory of all
cockroaches and tarantulas.</p>

<p><i>Wasp egg parasites.</i>&mdash;Matsumura (1917, <i>in</i> Asano, 1937) proposed
that parasitic wasps such as <i>Evania</i> and <i>Brachygaster</i> be protected in
Japan as the natural enemies of cockroaches. In one area in France,
20 percent of the o&ouml;thecae of <i>Loboptera decipiens</i> were parasitized by
<i>Zeuxevania splendidula</i> (Genieys, 1924). Edmunds (1952a) found
that 12 percent of 459 o&ouml;thecae of <i>Parcoblatta</i> collected during December
through April of 1950-51 in Ohio were parasitized; evaniids
accounted for about 7 percent of the parasitization. Additional collection
data in 1951-52 Edmunds (1953a) showed that 8.7 percent of
320 wood-cockroach o&ouml;thecae were parasitized; 2.8 percent of these
parasites were evaniids; almost 13 percent of the egg capsules collected
showed evidence of previous parasite emergence. Cameron
(1957) reported that o&ouml;thecae of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> collected in
Saudi Arabia were 29 percent parasitized in March and 25 percent
parasitized in October by <i>Evania appendigaster</i>. Sonan (1924) found
1 of 65 o&ouml;thecae of <i>P. americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i> parasitized by
<i>E. appendigaster</i> in Formosa.</p>

<p>Cottam (1922) stated that the increase of <i>Supella supellectilium</i>
in Khartoum was checked by a wasp egg-parasite that was later
identified as <i>Anastatus tenuipes</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_246">246</a>) (Ferri&egrave;re, 1930, 1935).
In this country, this wasp seemed to be effective in decreasing the numbers
of <i>Supella</i> in certain areas in Arizona (Flock, 1941).</p>

<p>In Formosa, <i>Tetrastichus hagenowii</i> was an important parasite of
cockroach eggs (Maki, 1937). Sonan (1924) reported 30 percent
parasitization of 65 o&ouml;thecae of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>P. australasiae</i>
collected in Formosa. In Bangalore, India, the natural parasitization
of randomly collected o&ouml;thecae of <i>P. americana</i> varied from
21 percent (of 495 o&ouml;thecae), July 1947-June 1948, and 43 percent
(of 288 o&ouml;thecae), July-December 1948, to 57 percent (of 178 o&ouml;thecae),
July-October 1949 (Usman, 1949). Cameron (1955) obtained
<i>T. hagenowii</i> from o&ouml;thecae collected in Trinidad, B.W.I., and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Saudi Arabia; some 15 percent of the o&ouml;thecae of <i>P. americana</i> and
<i>P. australasiae</i> collected in October in Trinidad were parasitized; a
later collection (March) was 34 percent parasitized; a small sample
of <i>P. americana</i> o&ouml;thecae was 65 percent parasitized. The o&ouml;thecae
collected in Saudi Arabia in March were 20 percent parasitized.
Plank (1947) found that the eggs of the American cockroach in
Puerto Rico (probably in laboratory cultures) were so heavily parasitized
by <i>T. hagenowii</i> that he had to use <i>P. australasiae</i> for experimental
purposes; in 1950 Plank stated that more than 50 percent of
American cockroach o&ouml;thecae were parasitized.</p>

<p>Fahringer (1922) stated that <i>Prosevania punctata</i> could be used to
eradicate cockroaches, but he did not test his hypothesis. Marlatt
(1902) felt that the usefulness of <i>Evania appendigaster</i> in biological
control was impaired by <i>Tetrastichus</i> acting as a hyperparasite (see
footnote 6, p. <a href="#Page_236">236</a>). However, Wolcott (1951) stated that in Puerto
Rico <i>E. appendigaster</i> is quite abundant and is a factor of considerable
importance in controlling cockroaches. Kadocsa (1921) stated that
<i>Brachygaster minutus</i> and <i>Evania appendigaster</i> were not important
in the biological control of cockroaches. These general statements
are not supported by experimental evidence.</p>

<p>It is likely that the smaller wasp egg parasites are more effective
than the evaniids in controlling cockroaches. Only one evaniid develops
in a parasitized o&ouml;theca, but many individuals of the other
wasps develop in one o&ouml;theca and the number of females that emerge
is usually large. However, Cameron (1957) concluded that, with a
parasitism rate of 25 to 29 percent and three to four generations a
year, against one or less for the host, <i>Evania appendigaster</i> in the
areas where it is established is a valuable control agent.</p>

<p>The use of specific egg parasites to control cockroaches has not been
attempted extensively. Cros (1942) liberated a species of <i>Tetrastichus</i>
(=<i>Eulophus</i> sp.; see p. <a href="#Page_254">254</a>) in his home in Algeria to control the
oriental cockroach; as far as we know, he did not report the parasite's
effectiveness in reducing the cockroach population. According to
Zimmerman (1948) <i>Comperia merceti</i>, when accidentally imported,
practically wiped out <i>Supella supellectilium</i> in parts of Hawaii; he
claimed to have controlled the brown-banded cockroach in a store
building with this parasite. In some parts of Honolulu, almost 100
percent of the o&ouml;thecae of this cockroach were parasitized (Zimmerman,
1944). We (1954b) ran some simulated field tests in which we
liberated <i>Tetrastichus hagenowii</i> in rooms artificially seeded with
o&ouml;thecae; from 28 to 83 percent of American cockroach o&ouml;thecae and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
56 percent of oriental cockroach o&ouml;thecae were parasitized during
these tests.</p>

<p><i>Evania appendigaster</i> was introduced from Hawaii into Canton
Island in 1940 against <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, and it has become
established (Dumbleton, 1957). This parasite was also successfully
introduced into Samoa (Dumbleton, 1957).</p>

<p><i>Cockroach-hunting wasps.</i>&mdash;An earnest attempt has been made to
establish in Hawaii wasps that prey on cockroaches. Just how effective
these wasps are in controlling cockroaches is still unknown. <i>Dolichurus
stantoni</i> was introduced from the Philippines in 1917 and
spread to several of the Islands (Swezey, 1920, 1921; Williams,
1944). Bridwell (1920) stated that as a result of this introduction
there was a great decrease in cockroaches of the genus "<i>Phyllodromia</i>."
A number of <i>Podium haematogastrum</i> from Brazil were
liberated in Honolulu (Williams, 1925) but did not become established
(Williams, 1928). The effectiveness of <i>Podium</i> was questioned by
Williams (1928) who observed that <i>Podium</i> "destroyed innumerable
Blattidae, which nonetheless swarmed in their neighborhood, and I
must confess from my observations on the various cockroach-hunting
wasps that the blattid more than holds its own alongside its enemy."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Introductions of <i>Ampulex</i> have proved more successful. <i>Ampulex
canaliculata</i> was introduced into Hawaii from the United States (Williams,
1928a, 1929). Williams also introduced <i>A. compressa</i> into
Hawaii in 1940, and the species was reared in large numbers for
distribution (Pemberton, 1942). <i>A. compressa</i> has since become
established on most of the Islands (Pemberton, 1945a, 1947; Williams,
1946; Van Zwaluwenburg, 1950). The thousand of <i>A.
compressa</i> now found in the Hawaiian Islands are all descendants of
three wasps captured in Noumea, New Caledonia (Williams, 1944).
According to Williams (1941), the number of cockroaches was noticeably
reduced at the University of Hawaii poultry farm, where some
<i>A. compressa</i> were released. Pemberton (1953) believed that this
wasp has become sufficiently abundant to be of definite value. Simmonds
(1941) recommended importing <i>A. compressa</i> into Fiji for
cockroach control. <i>A. compressa</i> was introduced from Hawaii into
Guam in 1954 against <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and into the Cook Islands
in 1955 against <i>Periplaneta</i> spp.; it is not yet known whether the
parasite became established in either place (Dumbleton, 1957).</p>

<p class="right"><span class="minor">
<span class="smcap">Girard</span> (1877)<br />
</span></p>

<p><i>Toads.</i>&mdash;<i>Bufo marinus</i> was first introduced into Puerto Rico from
Barbados in 1920 to reduce several major insect pests including cockroaches
(Leonard, 1933). It was introduced from Puerto Rico into
Hawaii by C. E. Pemberton in 1932 where it rapidly became established;
it has since been distributed throughout the Pacific area. <i>B.
marinus</i> is one of the world's largest toads; it attains a body length
(exclusive of the hind legs) of 7 to 9 inches (Oliver, 1949) and has
been kept alive for more than 11 years in captivity (Pemberton,
1945). Alicata (1938) placed giant toads in a fenced area in Hawaii
containing an infestation of <i>Pycnoscelus surinamensis</i>; after 24 hours
the toads were dissected and each was found to have eaten from 11
to 25 cockroaches. Illingworth (1941) found that 40 to 90 percent
of 53 stools of this toad in Hawaii contained remains of <i>P. surinamensis</i>.
Alicata (1947) recommended the maintenance of <i>B. marinus</i>
in poultry yards to reduce the population of <i>P. surinamensis</i>, the
vector of the chicken eye worm.</p>

<p>Toads have also been recommended for controlling cockroaches in
houses (Meech, 1889; Sweetman, 1936). Girard (1877) cited a note
in a French newspaper which stated that toads were kept in houses in
Cuba to control the American cockroach.</p>

<p><i>Tree frogs.</i>&mdash;Tree frogs enclosed in a room overnight were said
to effectively clear it of cockroaches (Marlatt, 1915); on sugar plantations
in Australia, these amphibians were encouraged in houses and
kept as pets because they hunted and devoured large brown cockroaches
(Froggatt, 1906).</p>

<p><i>Birds.</i>&mdash;In Guadeloupe, Dutertre (1654) claimed that all the fowls
of the country were fond of small cockroaches and lived on practically
nothing else. In Hawaii (Zimmerman, 1948) and in the Lesser Antilles
(Ballou, 1912) cockroaches are eaten by poultry whenever the
birds can find them. In Puerto Rico, Wetmore (1916) stated that
owls kept in houses feed extensively on cockroaches; the stomach of
one owl which had been kept in a native house was filled entirely with
cockroaches. In British Guiana, Beebe (1925) found that cockroaches
were eaten by 27 species of birds.</p>

<p><i>Reptiles.</i>&mdash;H. (1800) claimed that two lizards cleared his house
of the "true brown cockroach" and suggested that lizards be used for
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
cockroach control because the reptiles are docile and harmless. On
Arno Atoll geckos and night-feeding skinks eat large numbers of
cockroaches (Usinger and La Rivers, 1953). According to Wolcott
(1924) the number of cockroaches eaten by lizards is surprisingly
large considering the nocturnal habits of these insects. Beebe (1925a)
kept geckos in a bungalow to help control <i>Periplaneta</i> and <i>Pycnoscelus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mammalia.</i>&mdash;Cowan (1865) stated that in England hedgehogs were
often kept domesticated in kitchens to destroy cockroaches. This
writer also stated that a lemur was kept on board ship to destroy
cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Large numbers of the American and Australian cockroaches were
eaten by the mongoose in Hawaii (Perkins, 1913).</p>

entries are placed in the index as unmodified substantives except where a modifier
contributes significantly to the identification of the item (e.g., blue heads, prairie

natural associations (pages <a href="#Page_290">290</a> to <a href="#Page_310">310</a>) because these are not repeated here.
All experimental associations are indexed below except those involving <i>Blatta

intermediate stages in cockroaches: <i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i> (Rudolphi, 1819)
[Blanchard (1891)]; <i>Inermicapsifer madagascariensis</i> (Davaine in Grenet,
1870) [Baer (1956)]; <i>Spirocerca sanguinolenta</i> (Rudolphi, 1819) [Seurat
(1913)]. These doubtful records are discussed in Roth and Willis (1957a).</p>

genus is <i>Ripidius</i> and not <i>Rhipidius</i>, as it is frequently written, and that, consequently,
the family should be Ripiphoridae and not Rhipiphoridae.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Page 11 of Marlatt (1902) has been cited erroneously so many times in
support of host records for <i>T. hagenowii</i> and <i>Evania appendigaster</i> that we are
quoting the pertinent section below. In the section preceding the quoted material
Marlatt discusses the American, Australian, oriental, and German cockroaches.
There is nothing in the paper to connect any of these cockroaches specifically
with the parasites mentioned below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NATURAL ENEMIES AND PARASITES</p>
<p>"In Europe the egg capsules of the cockroach are often parasitized by an
ichneumon fly (<i>Evania appendigaster</i>). This insect has become widely distributed
over the world following its host insect, and has been redescribed under
a great many different names. It was found in Cuba as early as 1829, and has
been several times collected in the United States. Unfortunately, its usefulness
as a means of keeping the roach in check by destroying the egg capsules is
greatly impaired by the occurrence of another ichneumon fly (<i>Entedon hagenowi</i>),
which is parasitic upon the first. This is also a European species which
has been brought over with its host parasite. If the true egg capsule parasite of
the roach could have been introduced into this country without this secondary
parasite, its usefulness would doubtless have been very much greater. The secondary
parasite, however, seems to have been introduced early, and has been
found in Cuba and Florida, and probably occurs as widely as its host and prevents
the latter from multiplying very greatly."</p>

the pronotal shields of his species with the descriptions by Hebard (1917) of
<i>B. craniifer</i> and <i>Blaberus atropos</i> (Stoll). The Chilean <i>B. fusca</i> Brunner is a
